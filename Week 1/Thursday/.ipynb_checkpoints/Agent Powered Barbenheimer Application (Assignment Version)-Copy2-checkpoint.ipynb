       "[Document(page_content='Barbie is a 2023 American fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig from a screenplay she wrote with Noah Baumbach. Based on the Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel, it is the first live-action Barbie film after numerous computer-animated films and specials. The film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis. It features an ensemble supporting cast, including America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Helen Mirren, Issa Rae, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.\\nA live-action Barbie film was announced in September 2009 by Universal Pictures with Laurence Mark producing. Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018. Robbie was cast in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2020. The rest of the cast were announced in early 2022. Filming took place primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England and on the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July 2022.\\nBarbie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 21 by Warner Bros. Pictures. Its simultaneous release with Universal\\'s Oppenheimer led to the \"Barbenheimer\" cultural phenomenon, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film received critical acclaim and has grossed $1.212 billion worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2023, as the highest-grossing film of all time solely directed by a woman, and the 25th highest-grossing film of all-time.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nStereotypical Barbie (\"Barbie\") and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland; a matriarchal society with different variations of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models, who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it as their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs such as doctors, lawyers, and politicians. Beach Ken (\"Ken\") is only happy when he is with Barbie and seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships.\\nAt a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken with worries about mortality. Overnight, she develops bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, disrupting her usual routines the next day. Weird Barbie, an outcast due to her disfigurement, tells her she must find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Ken stows away in her convertible hoping to join her on the journey, to which Barbie reluctantly agrees.\\nArriving at Venice Beach, Barbie punches a man for groping her, leading to her and Ken\\'s brief arrest. Alarmed by their presence, Mattel\\'s CEO orders their recapture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a tween girl named Sasha, who criticizes her for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and Sasha\\'s mother, inadvertently catalyzed her existential crisis after Gloria began playing with Sasha\\'s old Barbie toys in a similar state. Mattel attempts to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha\\'s help and the three travel to Barbieland with Mattel executives in pursuit.\\nMeanwhile, Ken learns about the patriarchal system and feels respected for the first time. Returning to Barbieland, he persuades the other Kens to take over, and the Barbies are indoctrinated into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and unsuccessfully tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were. She becomes depressed, but Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society\\'s conflicting expectations of women, restoring Barbie\\'s self-confidence.\\nWith the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Allan, and the discontinued dolls, Gloria convinces the Barbies to free themselves from subordination. The Barbies manipulate the Kens into fighting amongst themselves, distracting them from enshrining male superiority into Barbieland\\'s constitution, and the Barbies regain power. Having now experienced systemic oppression for themselves, the Barbies resolve to rectify the faults of their previous society, emphasizing better treatment of the Kens and all outcasts.\\nBarbie and Ken apologize to each other, acknowledging their mistakes. Ken bemoans that he has no purpose without Barbie, so Barbie encourages him to find an autonomous identity. Barbie, who remains unsure of her own identity, meets with the spirit of Ruth Handler, Mattel co-founder and creator of the Barbie doll, who explains that Barbie\\'s story has no set ending and her ever-evolving history surpasses her roots.\\nAfter the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband, and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name \"Barbara Handler\", to her first gynecological appointment.\\n\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n\\n\\n== Production ==\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nDevelopment on a film based on the Barbie toy line began in September 2009, when it was announced that Mattel had signed a partnership to develop the project with Universal Pictures and with Laurence Mark as producer, but nothing came to fruition. In April 2014, Mattel teamed with Sony Pictures to produce the film, which would have Jenny Bicks writing the screenplay and Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes producing through the Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation banner they created. Filming at the time was anticipated to begin by the end of the year. In March 2015, Diablo Cody was brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, and Amy Pascal joined the producing team. Sony Pictures would again have rewrites done to the screenplay later that year, hiring Lindsey Beer, Bert V. Royal, and Hillary Winston to write separate drafts.In December 2016, Amy Schumer entered negotiations to star in the title role with Winston\\'s screenplay; Schumer helped rewrite the script with her sister, Kim Caramele. In March 2017, Schumer exited negotiations, blaming scheduling conflicts with the planned June 2017 filming start; in 2023 she revealed she left the project due to creative differences with the film\\'s producers at the time. That July, Anne Hathaway was under consideration for the title role, with Sony Pictures hiring Olivia Milch to rewrite the screenplay and approaching Alethea Jones to direct as a means to interest Hathaway into signing on. Jones was attached to direct by March 2018.In August 2018, Robbie Brenner had been hired as producer by Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz with the rights reverting to Mattel, with Kreiz having the intention to repossess the rights following the expiration of Sony Pictures\\'s option. Later, Brenner was hired to run Mattel Films. The expiration of Sony Pictures\\'s option on the project in October 2018 and its transfer to Warner Bros. Pictures would see the departures of Hathaway, Jones, Macdonald, Parkes and Pascal. Margot Robbie would enter early talks for the role, with Patty Jenkins briefly considered for the director position. Kreiz was determined to cast Robbie in the titular role after meeting with her following his hiring as CEO as both he and Brenner had felt that Robbie\\'s appearance had been close to the appearance of a conventional Barbie doll and had been impressed by her ideas. Initial meetings had occurred at the Polo Lounge located in The Beverly Hills Hotel. Eventually, Brenner had partnered with Robbie\\'s production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, with Robbie\\'s husband Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara also being enlisted as producers. Robbie\\'s casting was confirmed in July 2019.Robbie had also been the producer and had pitched the film to Warner Bros. During the green-light meeting, Robbie had compared the film to Steven Spielberg\\'s Jurassic Park (1993) and had also jokingly suggested that it would gross over a billion dollars. Later on, she approached Greta Gerwig as the screenwriter as she enjoyed Gerwig\\'s previous films, particularly Little Women (2019). Gerwig was in post-production for another film, and accepted the role on the condition that her partner, Noah Baumbach, would also write the screenplay. Gerwig signed on to also direct the film in July 2021. Robbie said that the film\\'s aim was to subvert expectations and give audiences \"the thing you didn\\'t know you wanted\".\\n\\n\\n=== Writing ===\\n\\nGerwig and Baumbach were given full creative freedom in writing the film. They collaborated on the screenplay during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns of 2020–2021 and described the writing process as \"open\" and \"free\". Gerwig\\'s film treatment consisted of an Abstract Poem on Barbie influenced by the Apostles\\' Creed. For the narrative arc, she was partially inspired by the 1994 non-fiction book Reviving Ophelia by Mary Pipher, which accounts the effects of societal pressures on American adolescent girls. She also found inspiration in classic Technicolor musicals such as The Red Shoes (1948) and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), and said: \"They have such a high level of what we came to call authentic artificiality. You have a painted sky in a soundstage. Which is an illusion, but it\\'s also really there. The painted backdrop is really there. The tangibility of the artifice is something that we kept going back to.\" The script also contains candid criticism of Mattel, which created skepticism among Mattel officials when they received the first version. However, Kreiz decided to trust Gerwig. Brenner noted that \"being safe in this world doesn\\'t work\" as she interpreted Barbie to be a \"bold\" and \"trailblazer\" figure. As a result, Will Ferrell\\'s portrayal as the Mattel CEO was meant to be an allegory for corporate America. Kreiz praised Ferrell and said that while Mattel officials took their brands seriously, they did not take themselves seriously. Gerwig and Robbie had both felt the film was \"most certainly a feminist film\" but Mattel officials had rejected the description. Both Gerwig and Robbie had informed the studio that they would also explore the controversies and problematic parts of Barbie, but they had also convinced the studio that they would respect the product.Gerwig was also influenced by her childhood experiences with Barbie. Her mother had discouraged her from purchasing the dolls, but eventually allowed her to. Opting to acknowledge the controversial nature of the Barbie doll, Gerwig chose to create a film in which she would be both \"doing the thing and subverting the thing\", in the sense that she would be celebrating the feminism behind Barbie while also noting the controversial beauty standards associated with it. She was also fascinated by the idea that humans create dolls, which in turn imitate humans, feeling that \"we\\'re in constant conversation with inanimate objects\" while also conveying an affirmative message to the audience to \"just be yourself and know that that\\'s enough\". The film deliberately juxtaposed contradictory messaging, such as critiquing consumerism yet glamorizing plastic products, and in the ending of the film, in which Barbie desires to be more than just a plastic doll. Gerwig made the film as an \"earnest attempt to make amends\" with the intention of affirming the worth of women and conveying the impossibility of perfection, which some perceived to be standards associated with Barbie. Reflecting upon the maximalism of Barbie, Gerwig said that the \"ontology of Barbie\" was similar to what she perceived as Shakespeare\\'s maximalism, which she had enjoyed in his works. She grounded the film in what she described as a \"heightened theatricality that allows you to deal with big ideas in the midst of anarchic play\".Gerwig described the film as being anarchic, unhinged, and humanist. She felt that the film originated from the \"deep isolation of the pandemic\", opining that the line in which Margot Robbie says \"Do you guys ever think about dying?\" exemplifies the film\\'s anarchic nature. She also found the idea of Barbie being \"constrained in multitudes\" as \"all of these women are Barbie and Barbie is all of these women\" to be \"trippy\" and felt as a result, Barbie did not need to have her own personal life, as she was attuned to her environment. She also described the story as mirroring a girl\\'s journey from childhood to adolescence, though she did not deem it to be a coming of age film and felt that the film ultimately \"ends up, really, about being human\".Primarily, she began her writing by interpreting Barbie as living in a utopia and eventually experiencing reality, where she would have to \"confront all the things that were shielded from them in this place [Barbieland]\". She also drew parallels to the story of Adam and Eve and taking inspiration from John Milton\\'s Paradise Lost, particularly being inspired by the concept that there is \"no poetry without pain\". To underscore the tragic elements of Barbie and Ken facing the real world, she focused on elements of dissonance. As such, she chose to keep a scene featuring Robbie\\'s Barbie telling an older woman that she\\'s beautiful after being requested to remove it, as she felt that the scene epitomized \"the heart of the movie\". She also desired to provide a \"counterargument\" to Barbie by featuring a scene in which Barbie learns that some women do not like her, and felt it gave the film \"real intellectual and emotional power\". As such, a scene is featured in which Barbie is being stared at inappropriately on the Venice Beach, which Gerwig chose to feature as she felt it was a universal experience, being especially relevant for actors. She was inspired by an audition she did in which she wore overalls and felt that she did not perform well in. The ending of the film features Barbie saying the line \"I\\'m here to see my gynecologist\", with Gerwig describing it as a \"mic drop kind of joke\". She had chosen to include the line as she had wanted to instill confidence in younger girls, as she had been embarrassed about her body when she was younger.Barbie also explores the negative consequences of hierarchical power structures, with Gerwig saying that she extrapolated that \"Barbies rule and Kens are an underclass\" and felt it was similar to the Planet of the Apes. Ken has low self-esteem and seeks approval from Barbie, which Gerwig identified as a good source for a story. Gosling compared Gerwig\\'s vision to Milton Glaser\\'s I Love New York logo as he felt Gerwig created the film\\'s characters as a way of understanding the contemporary world. Ken has the only power ballad in the film, and Gerwig had identified it as the moment in which she felt the film transcended what a Barbie movie traditionally should have been.\\n\\n\\n=== Casting ===\\nDuring the casting process, Gerwig and Robbie looked for actresses with \"Barbie energy\" (which was described as \"a certain ineffable combination of beauty and exuberance\").In October 2021, Ryan Gosling entered final negotiations to play Ken in the film. America Ferrera, Simu Liu and Kate McKinnon were cast in February 2022. Liu auditioned for the film after his agent raved about the script being one of the best they had ever read. In March 2022, Ariana Greenblatt, Alexandra Shipp, and Emma Mackey were revealed to be in the cast. Will Ferrell joined the cast in April, along with Issa Rae, Michael Cera, Hari Nef, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Rhea Perlman, Ncuti Gatwa, Emerald Fennell, Sharon Rooney, Scott Evans, Ana Cruz Kayne, Connor Swindells, Ritu Arya and Jamie Demetriou. In April 2023, a trailer revealed that John Cena had joined the cast. It was later reported that Cena had spontaneously been offered a part in the film after paying for Robbie\\'s meal in London during production. Helen Mirren narrated the film\\'s trailer and the film itself.Robbie wanted Gal Gadot to play a Barbie in the film, but Gadot was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts. Gerwig wanted her frequent collaborators Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan to make cameo appearances, but neither was available, Gerwig revealed that during a visit to the set, Chalamet said he should have been in the film. Additionally, Bowen Yang, Dan Levy and Ben Platt were considered for Ken; Jonathan Groff was the first choice for Allan but turned it down.\\n\\n\\n=== Set design ===\\nSarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer serve as set designer and decorator, respectively, on the film. For the Barbie Dreamhouse, the pair drew inspiration from the mid-century modernist architecture found in Palm Springs, including the Kaufmann Desert House by Richard Neutra, as well as the photography of Slim Aarons. Gerwig wanted to capture \"what was so ridiculously fun about the Dreamhouses\", alluding to its previous models, and referenced Pee-wee\\'s Big Adventure, the paintings of Wayne Thiebaud, and Gene Kelly\\'s apartment flat in the 1951 Technicolor musical An American in Paris. \"Everything needed to be tactile, because toys are, above all, things you touch\", Gerwig was quoted saying of the use of practical effects instead of CGI to capture the sky and the San Jacinto Mountains. The set design is also noted for its extensive use of a specific shade of pink paint, Pantone 219. The company already had an international shortage due to COVID-19 related supply chain issues as well as freezing temperatures damaging stock; set design for the film used up the company\\'s entire remaining stock of pink. She also sought to use practical builds and had to first film sequences in miniature models and then composite the footage onto the actual image. She had already discussed the production design with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Greenwood, and costume designer Jacqueline Duran a year beforehand to prepare for the film. Gerwig also called the director Peter Weir for inspiration on Barbie Land, with the idea of creating it as an \"interior soundstage world\".\\n\\n\\n=== Costumes ===\\nCostume designer Jacqueline Durran, who previously collaborated with Gerwig on Little Women (2019), employed a practical approach to create Barbie\\'s wardrobe: \"The defining characteristic of what she wears is where she\\'s going and what she\\'s doing, [i]t\\'s about being completely dressed for your job or task.\" To match the film\\'s Barbieland setting, Durran and her team created costumes made of roughly fifteen color combinations \"that riffed off the idea of a French Riviera beach in the early 1960s\" and drew inspiration from actress Brigitte Bardot. For Ken\\'s outfits, Durran zeroed in a look composed of colorful sportswear from the 1980s, while actor Ryan Gosling suggested a Ken-branded underwear for the character. Durran closely adapted outfits from past iterations of Barbie dolls, such as the 1993 \"Western Stampin\\'\" dolls and the 1994 \"Hot Skatin\\'\" dolls. She noted the Barbie dolls as \"a very useful way to look at different ideas of femininity: what that means, who owns it, and who it\\'s aimed at\" and reflected this idea in how she dressed the characters. While the majority of the clothing featured in the film were sourced by Durran and her team, they also pulled pieces from the fashion archives of Chanel.\\n\\n\\n=== Filming ===\\nPrincipal photography began on March 22, 2022, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in England and wrapped on July 21, 2022. Among the notable filming locations was the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles, California. Rodrigo Prieto served as cinematographer. Prior to filming, Gerwig had organized a sleepover with the female cast members for them to establish positive relationships while also feeling that it \"would be the most fun way to kick everything off\". She also opted to use filming techniques from the 1950s, as Barbie has been a popular toy since 1959, with the intention of recreating a period-accurate look. Additionally, she also watched Powell and Pressburger\\'s A Matter of Life and Death (1946) to understand how older visual effects were used to provide a sense of theatricality. To highlight the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken facing the difficulties of the real world, she directed Robbie and Gosling to act as if they were in a drama. Reshoots took place in Los Angeles in April 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Music ==\\n\\nAlexandre Desplat, who collaborated with Gerwig on Little Women (2019), was set to score Barbie in early September 2022. However, by May 2023, Desplat had left the project, with Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt taking over scoring duties. The score was released by WaterTower Music on August 4, 2023.In addition to the score, Ronson was tasked with curating a compilation soundtrack that matched Gerwig\\'s vision for Barbie. As the film was being edited in post-production, Ronson and Gerwig would show scenes from the film to artists they wanted on the soundtrack. The film\\'s soundtrack, Barbie: The Album, was released on July 21, 2023. The album features songs by artists Ava Max, Charli XCX, Dominic Fike, Fifty Fifty, Gayle, Haim, Ice Spice, Kali, Karol G, Khalid, Sam Smith, Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Billie Eilish, PinkPantheress, Tame Impala, the Kid Laroi, and cast members Ryan Gosling and Dua Lipa. \"Dance the Night\" by Dua Lipa was released as the album\\'s lead single on May 26, 2023. It was followed by \"Watati\" by Karol G on June 2, 2023. \"Angel\" by PinkPantheress was released on June 9, 2023, as the first promotional single. \"Barbie World\" by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice was released as the album\\'s third single on June 23, 2023. The album\\'s second promotional single, \"Speed Drive\" by Charli XCX was released on June 30, 2023. On July 6, 2023, the album\\'s third and final promotional single, \"Barbie Dreams\" by Fifty Fifty and Kaliii was released. On July 10, 2023, Warner Bros. released a preview clip of Ryan Gosling singing \"I\\'m Just Ken\". The album\\'s fourth single, \"What Was I Made For?\" by Billie Eilish, was released on July 13, 2023.Despite fan expectations for the 1997 song \"Barbie Girl\" by the pop band Aqua to feature in the film, Ulrich Møller-Jørgensen, manager for Aqua lead singer Lene Nystrøm, said that it was not used, while Variety speculated that this was due to bad relations between Mattel and MCA Records, the song\\'s American publisher, who engaged in a series of lawsuits over the song from 1997 to 2002. \"Barbie World\", a rework of the song, was instead featured in the film. It samples \"Barbie Girl\"; Aqua is credited as a performer and co-writer on the track.The film features multiple renditions of the 1989 song \"Closer to Fine\" by the Indigo Girls and the 1997 song \"Push\" by Matchbox Twenty, the latter of which Ken adopts as his favorite song after visiting the real world, which becomes \"a tongue-in-cheek anthem of patriarchal dominance\" in the fictional Barbieland. While many reviews of the film interpreted this as a critique of the song, director Greta Gerwig said that she was a fan of Matchbox Twenty and \"I never put anything in a movie I don’t love.\"\\n\\n\\n== Marketing ==\\nBarbie was promoted with an extensive marketing campaign. In the months leading up to the release of the film, Mattel entered into several Barbie-themed promotional partnerships and collaborations with various brands, including Airbnb, Aldo, Bloomingdale\\'s, Burger King Brazil, Chi Haircare, Forever 21, Gap, Hot Topic, Krispy Kreme Philippines, Primark, Progressive Insurance, Spirit Halloween, Ulta, and Xbox. Additionally, studio parent company Warner Bros. Discovery engaged in cross-promotion for the film through its TV channels, most prominently with an HGTV renovation reality competition series titled Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge, coproduced by Mattel Television, which premiered shortly before the film\\'s release. Trade publication Variety reported that Warner Bros. spent $150 million on marketing for Barbie—more than the $145 million budget used to produce the movie itself.A first-look image of the film was revealed during a Warner Bros. presentation at CinemaCon in April 2022. Released to the public on April 27, 2022, the image saw Margot Robbie as Barbie, sitting behind the wheel of her iconic pink 1956 Chevrolet Corvette. Collider complimented Robbie in the image, stating: \"This photo is just further proof that Robbie was made to play this role. She just looks like a Barbie doll come to life—it\\'s almost uncanny\". On June 15, 2022, a second still featuring Ryan Gosling as Ken was released. Despite noting similarities between his look in the image and his previous roles, The Guardian asserted that \"there is a very strong chance that this will be [Gosling\\'s] defining role\".A booth dedicated to Barbie was opened at the 2022 CCXP event in São Paulo, Brazil. The first teaser trailer for the film debuted during preview screenings of Avatar: The Way of Water in December 2022. It featured a parody of the opening \"Dawn of Man\" sequence in Stanley Kubrick\\'s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which Robbie (clad in Barbie\\'s original 1959 outfit) imitates an alien monolith whose influence on the history of dolls is narrated by Mirren. Along with a theatrical poster, the teaser trailer was released to the public on December 16, 2022. Rolling Stone praised the 2001 homage and vibrant colors of the trailer, and remarked on its vague outlining of the plot: \"One has to wonder when, or better yet how, it will all get shaken up\".On April 4, 2023, twenty-four character posters of the several Barbies and Kens featured in the film—each tagged with brief descriptions—were shared on the Barbie\\'s social media accounts. Empire remarked: \"You might have thought that Multiverse fever would be constrained generally to comic book films and never-would-have-called-it Oscar winners [Everything Everywhere All at Once]. But ... it seems Greta Gerwig\\'s Barbie movie will also be flooding the screen with variants, this time of plastic dolls Barbie and Ken\". A second teaser trailer was unveiled shortly after the release of the posters. It featured a rendition of the Beach Boys\\' 1964 surf rock song \"Fun, Fun, Fun\". The Washington Post noted that the \"visually striking\" and \"polysemic\" teaser captivated multiple demographics because of its humor, color palette, and the Barbie doll\\'s cross-generational appeal. An official trailer for the film was released on May 25, 2023. Critics noted for its existential tone set against upbeat music. Ben Travis of Empire said: \"There\\'s much to discuss here—not least, that it looks visually impeccable\" and speculated Academy Awards attention for its production and costume design.A parade float was featured at the 2023 WeHo Pride Parade in Los Angeles to promote the film. Two of its LGBTQ+ cast members, Alexandra Shipp and Scott Evans, were present during the event.In June 2023, a French Barbie poster went viral for including the tagline \"Elle peut tout faire. Lui, c\\'est juste Ken.\", which literally translates to \"She can do everything. He\\'s just Ken.\" However, ken is the verlan slang term for \"fuck\" in French, i.e. the phonological inversion of nique, while c\\'est (\"he is\") is a homophone for sait (\"he knows how\"), meaning the tagline could be read as \"She can do everything. He just knows how to fuck.\" Analysts concluded that it was likely that the pun was intentional, as the slang term is common knowledge among French speakers, though Warner Bros. would neither confirm nor deny whether this was the case.\\nLeading up to the release, pink billboards, blank apart from the film\\'s release date, have appeared worldwide, and a real-world \"Barbie Dreamhouse\" in Malibu, California became available to rent through Airbnb.On July 14, 2023, SAG-AFTRA, an American labor union of film, television, and voice actors, declared a strike action, effectively halting any promotional event that involves any member in the guild. Robbie showed her support in the action. SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios \"duped\" the guild into accepting a 12-day extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films like Barbie.\\n\\n\\n== Release ==\\n\\n\\n=== Theatrical ===\\nBarbie had its world premiere at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, followed by the European premiere at Cineworld Leicester Square in London on July 12, 2023. It was released theatrically in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21, 2023, taking over the original release date of Coyote vs. Acme. Previous iterations of the project were set for June 2, 2017; May 12, 2017; June 29, 2018; August 8, 2018; and May 8, 2020.The film was released on the same day as Oppenheimer, a biographical film about J. Robert Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan based on the book American Prometheus, and distributed by Universal Pictures. Due to the tonal and genre contrast between the two films, many social media users created memes and ironic posts about how the two films appealed to different audiences, and how they should be viewed as a double feature. The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\". In an interview with La Vanguardia, Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy endorsed the phenomenon, saying, \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that\\'s cinema\\'s gain.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Home media ===\\nBarbie is scheduled to be released on digital formats on September 5, 2023.\\n\\n\\n=== Censorship ===\\n\\n\\n==== Nine-dash line controversy ====\\n\\nThe controversy over the alleged appearance of the nine-dash line (a maritime border running through the South China Sea set and claimed by the Government of the People\\'s Republic of China) in the film began when Vietnam\\'s film censorship authority banned the film for allegedly displaying such lines. In contrast, the Philippine counterpart instead requested that the lines in question be blurred. Both countries have banned the films Abominable (2019) and Uncharted (2022) for featuring the actual nine-dash line. The nine-dash line is controversial due to maritime border disputes between China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines.\\n\\n\\n===== Vietnam =====\\nOn July 3, 2023, Vietnamese newspaper Tuổi Trẻ quoted Vi Kiến Thành, head of the Department of Cinema, as announcing that Barbie would be banned in Vietnam because it contained \"the offending image of the nine-dash line.\" The Tiền Phong newspaper reported that the nine-dash line \"appears multiple times in the film\". The film was originally scheduled to be released in Vietnam on July 21.Speaking to Voice of America, Trịnh Hữu Long (founder of the research group Legal Initiatives for Vietnam) said, \"The censors will even be praised for overreacting to the unclear map, by both their superiors and the public, because anti-China sentiment runs deep into the country\\'s political culture\", and that \"the government is surely using legitimate nationalist reasoning to strengthen its entire censorship system\", while Michael Caster at the free expression group Article 19 said, \"Maps are political, and borders often bear historical wounds, but rather than ensuring free and open discussion, the knee jerk response to censor seldom supports historical or transitional justice\".Speaking to Vox, UC Berkeley professor Peter Zinoman said, \"To the Chinese, the nine-dash line signifies their legitimate claims to the South China Sea\", and \"to the Vietnamese, it symbolizes a brazen act of imperialist bullying that elevates Chinese national interest over an older shared set of interests of socialist brotherhood,\" while Harvard University professor Huệ-Tâm Hồ Tài said since the producers of the film were aiming for the mainland Chinese market in the hopes that it would be a blockbuster, \"they are ready to accept [mainland China\\'s] view of geography. Disinformation works by repetition.\" New York University professor Kevin Li said, \"In my view, banning [Barbie] was a no-brainer.\"In response to Vietnam\\'s ban, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press briefing on July 4 that the \"South China Sea issue\" should not be linked with \"normal cultural exchange\".\\n\\n\\n===== The Philippines =====\\nWhen news of Vietnam\\'s ban reached the Philippines, Senator Francis Tolentino, vice chairman of the Philippine Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, told CNN Philippines that Barbie may also be banned in the country because it \"denigrates\" Filipino sovereignty. Senator Jinggoy Estrada called the film to be banned over the alleged inclusion of the nine-dash line; opposition senator Risa Hontiveros quipped \"the movie is fiction, and so is the nine-dash line\", and suggested adding a disclaimer to the film instead of banning its release. Senator Robin Padilla, chairman of the Senate mass media committee, suggested that the film producers must edit out references to the nine-dash line or risk the film being banned.On July 11, the Philippines\\' Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) came to the conclusion that there was \"no basis\" to banning the film as the map was simply \"cartoonish\" and that there was no clear nor outright depiction of the nine-dash line, as the line in the film was \"not U-Shaped\" and had \"eight dots or dashes\" instead of nine. The board gave the film a PG rating, as well as allowing it to be screened in the country, however they requested Warner Bros. to \"blur the controversial lines in order to avoid further misinterpretations\". Senator Tolentino said that he respected the MTRCB\\'s decision, but expressed his dismay at it emerging a day before the seventh anniversary of the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that declared the nine-dash line had no legal basis on July 12, 2016. The film was released in the Philippines on July 19, 2023.\\n\\n\\n===== World map drawing and Warner Bros.\\' statement =====\\nWith the rising concerns over the alleged appearance of the nine-dash line, several media outlets pointed to a drawing of a world map which appears in a trailer for the film. The Los Angeles Times described the particular image as a \"map of \\'the real world\\' [which] looks as if it\\'s been drawn in crayon by a child\" with a line of dashes \"alongside the coast of what should be China.\" On July 6, 2023, Warner Bros. issued a statement explaining that the map in the concerned image is a \"child-like crayon drawing\", with the dashed lines depicting Barbie\\'s journey from Barbie Land to the real world and was \"not intended to make any type of statement\". Jordan Richard Schoenherr from Concordia University said that while the map might seem innocuous, the repeated presentation of images that supported the goals of the Chinese government risks increasing their acceptance by international publics and is therefore a cause for concern.\\n\\n\\n==== Religious interpretation and LGBTQ+ themes ====\\nIn Pakistan, the film was released nationwide on July 21, 2023. The Punjab Film Censor Board (which handles the censorship in the Punjab province) and other regional equivalents cleared the film for screening. But on July 22, Punjab province\\'s caretaker Minister of Information and Culture Amir Mir used his authority to halt the screenings of the film in the province, alleging that it \"[shows] homosexuality.\" Punjab\\'s Information Secretary Ali Nawaz Malik told Dawn that the film \"has been sent to Dubai for a censorship review.\" On August 1, the final approval was given for the film to be shown in the province.In the Middle East, the film was initially scheduled to be released on July 19, 2023, before being delayed to August 31. Later, Vox Cinemas, the distributor of Warner Bros. films in the region, announced that the film would be released in the region on August 10. Although the film censorship authorities in the region initially did not specify any reason, it was suggested that the inclusion of a transgender actress in one of Barbie roles, and the narrations and dialogs related to LGBTQ+ matters might have been the issues with the film.On August 9, 2023, Lebanon\\'s Minister of Culture Mohammad Mortada, who is backed by Hezbollah, proposed that the film be banned in the country for \"[promoting] homosexuality and sexual transformation\" and \"[contradicting] values of faith and morality\" by \"diminishing the importance of the family unit\". On August 11, it was reported that the Lebanese authority, comprising the representatives from the General Security and the Ministry of Economy and Trade, found no reason to ban the film in the country. As of August 15, the Minister of Interior and Municipalities is reportedly yet to receive the official report from the General Security.Also on August 9, 2023, the Kuwaiti authority formally announced the ban of both Barbie and Australian horror film Talk to Me (which stars a transgender actor), with the head of the authority Lafi Al-Subaie accusing the former of \"carrying ideas that encourage unacceptable behavior and distort society\\'s values.\"On August 13, 2023, just three weeks after its release on July 19, the screenings of Barbie were halted in film theaters in Algeria. According to Reuters, the official source was quoted as saying that the film \"promotes homosexuality and other Western deviances\" and that it \"does not comply with Algeria\\'s religious and cultural beliefs.\"\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Box office ===\\nAs of August 17, 2023, Barbie has grossed $545.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $660.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.206 billion.It was described as a \"record-breaking\" box office success during its opening weekend, and set the record for any film that was not a sequel, remake, or superhero property. The film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide on August 6, 2023, making it the first film by a solo female director to do so.\\n\\n\\n==== United States and Canada ====\\nIn the United States and Canada, Barbie was released alongside Oppenheimer, and was originally projected to gross $90–125 million from 4,243 theaters in its opening weekend, with Warner Bros. predicting a $75 million debut. The week of their release, AMC Theatres announced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day. It earned $70.5 million on its opening day, which included $22.3 million from Wednesday and Thursday night previews, both of which were the best of 2023. Barbie\\'s opening weekend gross of $162 million marked the largest opening since Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($181.3 million in November 2022). It was also the biggest opening ever for a film helmed by a female director, besting Captain Marvel (2019), and surpassed Suicide Squad (2016) to have Robbie\\'s highest opening weekend. It scored the third-highest July opening weekend at the time, behind The Lion King (2019) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011). This also marked the third-highest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film, after the latter film and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Barbie also scored the biggest opening for a movie based on a toy, surpassing Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009). The Barbenheimer phenomenon was widely credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend (52% for Barbie) being for the two films, a total of 18.5 million people.Following its opening weekend, Barbie surpassed The Dark Knight (2008) as the highest Monday gross ever for any Warner Bros. film, collecting a total of $26.1 million. In its second weekend, the film earned $92 million, dropping by 43%, which was the largest sophomore weekend ever for a Warner Bros. film and the seventh-largest ever. The film remained in first place with $53 million in its third weekend and $33.7 million in its fourth weekend. On August 16, 2023, Barbie once again surpassed The Dark Knight; this time as the highest-grossing domestic release in Warner Bros. history, having earned $537.5 million.\\n\\n\\n==== Other territories ====\\nOutside of the United States and Canada, Barbie earned $194.3 million from 69 offshore markets in its opening weekend. Of the 69 markets, it was the number one film for the weekend in 58, scored the largest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film in 26 and marked the largest opening for a 2023 film in 24. In the United Kingdom, the film opened with $24.2 million, which was the year\\'s largest opening. In France, it opened with $10.2 million, marking the largest debut for a Warner Bros. film since Joker (2019). The following weekend, Barbie earned $127 million, dropping by just 31%. It remained the number one film of the weekend in 57 markets. Within its sophomore weekend, it became the highest-grossing film of 2023 in Brazil, as well as the highest-grossing Warner Bros. release ever. In Australia, the film scored the largest second week ever, for a running total of $30.6 million after two weekends. In the UK, Barbie began outpacing the 10-day total of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, Warner Bros.\\' highest-grossing film in the region, in its second weekend. As of August 13, 2023, the film\\'s top five markets were the UK ($101.1 million), Mexico ($51.8 million), Australia ($47.3 million), Germany ($42.2 million) and Brazil ($42 million).\\n\\n\\n=== Critical response ===\\nBarbie attained critical acclaim. According to The New York Times, critics praised the script for addressing past criticisms of the Barbie brand\\'s portrayal of women and lack of diversity while infusing humor, but there were also critics who felt that it did not go far enough in critiquing consumerism and beauty standards. The performances of Robbie and Gosling received widespread acclaim.On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 449 critics\\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"Barbie is a visually dazzling comedy whose meta humor is smartly complemented by subversive storytelling.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100, based on 67 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 89% overall positive score, with 79% saying they would definitely recommend the film.In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Phillips called Barbie \"a lovely, eccentrically imaginative example of brand extension and raw, untrammeled commercialism\", applauded the production design, and summed: \"The crucial partnership here is the one between director and performer, Gerwig and Robbie; anything Gerwig and Baumbach\\'s verbally dexterous script requires, from Barbie\\'s first teardrop to the final punchline, Robbie handles with unerring precision\". Richard Brody of The New Yorker called it \"brilliant, beautiful and fun as hell\", claiming the \"giddily stylized vision of a doll coming to life makes a serious case for the art of adapting even the most sanitized I.P.\" and commended the \"free and wild\" direction as well as the \"profuse and exquisite\" visual aesthetics. Charlotte O\\'Sullivan of the Evening Standard hailed the film as \"easily the comedy of the year\" with a large amount of fun, where \"star and producer Margot Robbie, and writer-director Greta Gerwig, have done themselves proud\" with a \"breezily outrageous\" film \"about a woman’s right to be \\'weird, dark and crazy\\'.\" Eileen Jones of Jacobin said that the film \"manages to overcome cumbersome plotting and feminist pieties to provide a delightful spectacle of funny moments that add up to something pretty good.\" In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw awarded Barbie a 3 out of 5 stars, describing it as \"beamingly affectionate and deliriously pink-themed\" but \"perhaps a giant two-hour commercial for a product\" and highlighted Gosling as a scene-stealer, being given \"all the best lines\".Lovia Gyarke of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \"tricky balancing act of corporate fealty and subversion\" lauding Gerwig\\'s direction, the set design, costumes, soundtrack and lead performances, but criticizing the \"muddled politics and flat emotional landing\". Variety critic Peter Debruge praised the humor for giving \"permission to challenge what Barbie represents\" and lauded Gosling\\'s physical performance, but concluded that the film is an \"an intellectual experience, not an emotional one, grounded largely in audience nostalgia.\" In the Vulture component of New York, Alison Willmore commended the lead performances, particularly that of Robbie, whom she characterized is \"as capable of heartbreaking earnestness as humor, and who sometimes effortlessly achieved both at once\", but lamented on the themes of the film, opining that it \"doesn\\'t ultimately want to do much more than talk itself in circles about these themes\". On a similar note, Stephanie Zacharek of Time praised Robbie\\'s \"buoyant, charming performance\", Gosling\\'s \"go-for-broke\" effort, and the \"inventive production design\", but criticized the \"self aware\" nature of the film especially following the first half-hour, concluding that it is a feminist film \"only in the most scattershot way\", and that it\\'s not \"subversive\". Camilla Long of The Times wrote that the film featured Mattel\\'s \"pink, squealing, corporate grasping\", trying to be \"ahead of the sexism curve\", but \"ended up feeling sexist itself\" for its portrayal that \"men are stupid, go to the gym, run everything and don\\'t care about women, while women are sensible, striving but ultimately conflicted victims.\" In the review of Kyle Smith of The Wall Street Journal, he stated: \"As bubbly as the film appears, its script is like a grumpier-than-average women\\'s studies seminar\", exemplified by the Mattel employee character\\'s \"long monologue on how miserable it is to be female\".Chinese film critic Li Jingfei (李竞菲) praised the film\\'s humor and criticism of patriarchy, qualifying that its themes were too-often advanced by slogans rather than the experiences of its characters.\\n\\n\\n=== Accolades ===\\nBarbie won Best Teaser at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards. It won Most Anticipated Film at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.\\n\\n\\n== Themes and analysis ==\\nAs with the doll itself, feminism and related themes in the film were the subject of discussion. Some reviews for the film saw it as a satire that pokes fun at capitalism, while others perceived it as a satire that cleverly uses capitalist themes.\\n\\n\\n=== Philosophy ===\\nBarbie has been characterized as exploring themes of existentialism. Lucy Ford of GQ wrote that the film \"ruminates on the very idea of what makes us human, the idea of \\'the other\\', whether there\\'s truly such a thing as autonomy or if we\\'re all simply pawns to be picked up and disposed of when we are no longer useful\". Ford observed that, in the film, Barbie and Ken go on \"opposite but equal\" journeys of self-discovery, after venturing out into the Real World and learning that it is an oppressive patriarchal society as opposed to the matriarchal utopia that is Barbieland, and get \"caught in the crosshairs of being both sentient and someone else\\'s idea, battling with free will and the omnipresent predetermined rules about where to go and how to act\".In Vogue India, Varya Srivastava applied Beauvoirian concepts of existentialism and individualism to Barbie, arguing that \"individualism makes you question societal norms and expectations [...] Even for Barbie, this has been brewing for a while. She has tried to be inclusive and representative. She has tried to acknowledge the feminist critique and now has jobs like being the President, a scientist, a doctor. But the burden of being a role model in a world that is questioning morality and embracing multiplicity is a lot. Existentialism thrives in that gap between what is and what ought to be\". Clark University professor of philosophy Wiebke Deimling compared a scene in the film, in which Barbie has to make a choice between going back to her perfect life in Barbieland or learning the truth about her existence in the Real World, to the experience machine, a thought experiment by American philosopher Robert Nozick. Diemling also observed that gender in Barbieland is performative, noting how the Kens behave before and after a patriarchy was established.Alissa Wilkinson of Vox compared Barbieland to the biblical Garden of Eden, with Barbie and Ken as inverted parallels of Adam and Eve. She saw Barbie and Ken\\'s first impression \"that they\\'re suddenly self-conscious and aware of being looked at\" in the Real World as the film\\'s version of the Fall.Chinese film critic Li Jingfei (李竞菲) compared Barbie\\'s sudden awareness of death to the moment when Siddhārtha Gautama left the palace of his birth and first learned of suffering and death, which eventually led to his enlightenment.\\n\\n\\n=== Feminism ===\\nKatie Pickles of The Conversation observed that Barbie shows how the matriarchy can be \"as bad\" as the patriarchy, with the Kens being the objectified and excluded sex in Barbieland. Pickles further comments that the true heroes were outcasts such as Weird Barbie and Allan, who deprogrammed the Barbies from tolerating the status quo. She believes that this aligns with Gerwig\\'s conception of feminism, where \"everyone stands in the sunshine\".Jack Butler of National Review rejected the perception of the film as a \"shallow, man-hating, and repulsive screed\" and, in arguing that the film is instead a \"post-feminist satire of what feminists imagine a perfect world looking like and of what they imagine male dominance is like\", noted that in the Real World, \"Ken is rebuffed in all of his attempts to join the male hierarchy that purportedly dominates the world. He must return to Barbieland to institute it; what he institutes there is so shallow that it collapses almost as quickly as it is set up. Meanwhile, though Robbie\\'s Barbie restores female dominance in Barbieland, she chooses not to stay there, electing instead to become fully human\".Many journalists coupled Barbie with the Eras Tour by Taylor Swift for the concurrent representation of recontextualized mainstream femininity. Michelle Goldberg of The New York Times described the launch of the film and the tour, their rave public reception, and the associated critical discourses as the biggest cultural phenomena of 2023 summer, explaining that \"beneath their slick, exuberant pop surfaces, [both the film and the tour] tell female coming-of-age stories marked by existential crises and bitter confrontations with sexism.\" Ben Sisario considered both the works as critiques of patriarchy, while Talia Lakritz of Business Insider said both of them \"reclaim girlhood without rescinding power\". Similarly, Chris Willman stated that both use patriarchy as a subject of irony \"while being utterly friendly to and welcoming of men as much as anybody\", eventually becoming billion-dollar-earning phenomena.\\n\\n\\n=== Masculinity ===\\nIn the Los Angeles Times, Jean Guerrero presented a subtext to the film\\'s feminist exterior, in which \"a world that disregards men and their feelings is an inverted form of patriarchy and also cruel\", and added: \"The film is a rare product of mainstream culture that invites men to reimagine masculinity for their own sake. It acknowledges the identity crisis and loss of hope, economic promise and life purpose among American men. These struggles are often ignored by progressives, but conveniently and poisonously exploited by right-wing manfluencers from Andrew Tate to Josh Hawley [...] The film\\'s reception has focused on its messages of women\\'s empowerment, but what makes it a radical story is that it also invites women to reimagine feminism so that it doesn\\'t ignore male struggles\".Nicholas Balaisis contended in Psychology Today that Barbie provides a \"relatively nuanced portrayal of masculinity\" in two cases that resonated with issues and concerns frequent in clinical psychology and therapy: In the first case, which concerns with \"the over-valuation of a woman\\'s gaze and attention on male sense of self-esteem, and even an existential sense of identity\", Ken turns to patriarchal expression and masculine dominance \"over other men, women or objects\" because he doesn\\'t receive the \"sense of attractiveness, worth, and general self-value\" he wants from Barbie\\'s gaze and attention. In the second case, which concerns \"the relationship to shame or existential solitude and the conversion to sex-as-soothing\", when Barbie approaches Ken in the third act of the film for consolation, he interprets it as a sexual advance and tries to kiss her, which Dr. Balaisis likened to \"the same way that shame can quickly morph into resentment and anger, here we see loneliness and existential angst being converted into a sexual plea — for sex to solve and resolve these bad feelings\".Megan Garber of The Atlantic found Ken and his journey of self-discovery \"mimics adolescence\", describing \"Like any teenager, Ken is figuring out who he is, and trying the world’s possibilities on for size. But his immaturity is not contained, and this is its problem. His adolescent approach to the world, instead, inflicts itself on everyone else\". Garber concluded that Ken embodies a \"core idea\" in the film \"that patriarchy is a profound form of immaturity\". Eliana Dockterman of Time noted that Ken\\'s radicalization resembles the men\\'s rights movement, particularly in his \"feelings of emasculation\" and evangelization of the patriarchy.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of Barbie films\\nExistentialism in film and television\\nSelf-reflection\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website \\nBarbie at IMDb', metadata={'title': 'Barbie (film)', 'summary': 'Barbie is a 2023 American fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig from a screenplay she wrote with Noah Baumbach. Based on the Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel, it is the first live-action Barbie film after numerous computer-animated films and specials. The film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis. It features an ensemble supporting cast, including America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Helen Mirren, Issa Rae, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.\\nA live-action Barbie film was announced in September 2009 by Universal Pictures with Laurence Mark producing. Development began in April 2014, when Sony Pictures acquired the film rights. Following multiple writer and director changes and the casting of Amy Schumer and later Anne Hathaway as Barbie, the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018. Robbie was cast in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Gerwig was announced as director and co-writer with Baumbach in 2020. The rest of the cast were announced in early 2022. Filming took place primarily at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England and on the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles from March to July 2022.\\nBarbie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 21 by Warner Bros. Pictures. Its simultaneous release with Universal\\'s Oppenheimer led to the \"Barbenheimer\" cultural phenomenon, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film received critical acclaim and has grossed $1.212 billion worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2023, as the highest-grossing film of all time solely directed by a woman, and the 25th highest-grossing film of all-time.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_(film)'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A complete list of CGI or computer-animated feature films and streaming television films starring or featuring Barbie, a fashion doll manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel, is as follows.\\nIn response to a growing rise of digital and interactive media as well as the gradual decline of the sales in dolls, toys and accessories in the 1980s, Mattel partnered with animation studios to produce films which were broadcast on Nickelodeon in the United States from 2002 and released on home video formats, originally by Family Home Entertainment and successor Lionsgate, and then predominantly by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, both until 2017. From 2012 onwards, Mattel expanded the franchise beyond just the films to other audiovisual media such as web series, television shows and streaming television content, with the latter following the growing trend of streaming services and online platforms. In 2020, Mattel revamped the films into streaming television films, branding them as animated \"specials\" and integrating them into the canon of the inaugural television show in the Barbie media franchise, Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. Additionally, a live-action adaptation of the toyline was theatrically released on 21 July 2023 by Warner Bros. and Mattel Films, alongside LuckyChap Entertainment and Heyday Films.\\n\\n\\n== Adaptations and original plots (2001–2009) ==\\nMattel launched its eponymous in-house entertainment division in 2001 and began the Barbie film series by adapting pre-existing stories/tales, with CGI animation provided by Canadian studio Mainframe Entertainment. Elise Allen introduced original storylines to the series through screenwriting the main entries of the Barbie: Fairytopia franchise. In between their co-productions, American studio Curious Pictures pitched in by animating The Barbie Diaries (2006).\\nIn 2007, Mainframe was purchased by the Rainmaker Income Fund, subsequently rebranding as Rainmaker Entertainment the following year. The films were originally distributed on VHS and DVD by Artisan Entertainment and Family Home Entertainment from 2001 until 2004, when both were acquired by and folded into Lionsgate. In 2006, Mattel ceased distribution of the films on VHS and focused solely on DVD; at the same time, Universal (which had already held foreign distribution rights) took over the domestic distribution rights, after negotiations with Lionsgate broke down over the low amount offered by Mattel to continue distributing future Barbie films. Lionsgate was permitted to continue distribution of the titles released by them up to The Barbie Diaries for several years after; these rights eventually reverted to Mattel, who then authorized Universal to begin reissuing these titles.\\n\\n\\n=== Barbie in the Nutcracker (2001) ===\\nBased on The Nutcracker and the Mouse King by E. T. A. Hoffmann and The Nutcracker ballet music by Pyotr Illych Tchaikovsky, this inaugural film in the series stars Barbie narrating a story to her younger sister, Kelly, a story about a young girl named Clara who gets a beautiful wooden nutcracker from her aunt Elizabeth as a Christmas gift. Later that night, the toy comes alive to protect Clara from the evil Mouse King\\'s soldiers. Clara gets shrunk to toy size and along with her brave Nutcracker goes in search of a magical Sugarplum Princess to reverse a spell. In the midst of the adventure is the live nutcracker toy dancing with Clara at two intervals in the film.\\n\\n\\n=== Barbie as Rapunzel (2002) ===\\nThis 2nd entry based on the classic tale by the Brothers Grimm stars Barbie as Rapunzel, who is trapped in a tall tower by an evil witch. Hidden from the outside world, Rapunzel spends much of her day painting and dreaming of a happier life. After many years alone Rapunzel goes on a journey with her friends Penelope and Hobie to find her happily ever after. Written by Leila Kramer\\n\\n\\n=== Barbie of Swan Lake (2003) ===\\nThe 2nd ballet Barbie film in the franchise.

From 2012 onwards, Mattel expanded the franchise beyond just the films to other audiovisual media such as web series, television shows and streaming television content, with the latter following the growing trend of streaming services and online platforms. In 2020, Mattel revamped the films into streaming television films, branding them as animated \"specials\" and integrating them into the canon of the inaugural television show in the Barbie media franchise, Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures.

       " Document(page_content='Beginning with the release of an eponymous video game in 1984, Barbie, a fashion doll manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel and debuted on March 9, 1959, has been featured in a media franchise predominantly consisting of a film series and media formats across technologies like television and the Internet. Since then, it has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time and has been referred to among fans as the \"Barbie Cinematic Universe\".The film series were released direct-to-video from 2001 and aired regularly on Nickelodeon as television specials in the United States from 2002, with both running until early 2017. Since mid-2017, beginning with Barbie Dolphin Magic, Mattel revamped them into streaming television films, branded or marketed them as animated \"specials\" with a reduced 1-hour video length as opposed to the feature films beforehand and move them to streaming media services, predominantly Netflix, but also including Amazon Prime Video, Google Play and Apple TV+. These films released from late 2017 onwards could still be released on home video formats, although locally, or get picked up for television broadcast in multiple countries and regions/territories. Aside the film series, Barbie has been featured in other media formats including two animated syndicated television specials in Barbie and the Rockers: Out of This World and its sequel, Barbie and the Sensations: Rockin\\' Back to Earth, both in 1987, web series like Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse, Barbie: Vlogger, Barbie Dreamtopia and Barbie\\'s Dreamworld and Barbie: Life in the City, television shows like Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures and Barbie: It Takes Two, a live-action film and an interactive short film.\\n\\n\\n== Origins ==\\nBarbie debuted on March 9, 1959, at the American International Toy Fair (now the North American International Toy Fair) and it was well received locally in the United States, sparking a revolution in the toy industry. Since then, numerous likenesses of the doll were released which later evolved into what is now considered as \"Barbie\\'s friends and family\" and clothing and accessories to accompany them. Various print hardcover and comic books starring Barbie were also released through partnerships and/or deals with Dell Comics, Marvel Comics and currently Papercutz.In the 1980s, the net popularity and sales of the Barbie fashion doll on the toy market began to decline and struggled further in 2001 when MGA Entertainment introduced a line of dolls under the name Bratz, whose sexualized characters contrasted with Barbie\\'s older, chaste image. Mattel therefore attempted to overhaul the Barbie brand to keep the toy relevant to consumers in the modern age by bringing in consultants and conducting research on key market groups. Mattel consultants initially considered reducing the Barbie\\'s breast size, but later claimed that the doll\\'s figure could not be changed because \"being consistent is one of her biggest strengths\". Mattel\\'s team also considered targeting market audiences of career women and their daughters by introducing lines of Doctor or Lawyer Barbies. However, Mattel\\'s research showed that girls were spending more time online than playing with physical dolls. Therefore, targeted career Barbies were discarded in favor of looking for more interactive platforms through online or digital media.\\nIn response, Mattel began adapting Barbie into various facets of media and entertainment beyond the television advertisement of its dolls and related accessories (which was a prolific marketing strategy in the past) For the first 16 entries in the film series, Barbie is featured as a virtual actress playing the main character, and often being portrayed as a modern girl telling the story to one of her sisters or a younger friend – as a parable to present affairs. Scholars examining how the Barbie films differ from other princess narratives have concluded that Mattel intentionally attempted to remediate its brand based on feminist criticisms through storytelling in the films.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn 1987, Mattel produced two television specials with DIC Animation City and Saban Productions; Barbie and the Rockers: Out of This World and its sequel Barbie and the Sensations: Rockin\\' Back to Earth, both featuring Barbie as the leader of a rock band. Between the 1980s and early 2000s, Barbie got featured in video games, many of which were distributed by Vivendi-Universal Games. With the boom of home video marketing at the time, Mattel launched an eponymous in-house entertainment division in 2001 and began the creation of the Barbie films with the direct-to-video release of Barbie in the Nutcracker. The films initially revolved around Barbie being re-imagined as a princess and eventually expanded into various worlds of fashion and fantasy. A primary benefit of this strategy revolved around marketing, as Mattel could sell dolls specific to each film separately from the video sales and merchandise related to props, costumes and sets from the films.Tim Kilpin, then-senior vice-president for girls marketing at Mattel, stated: \"What you see now are several different Barbie worlds anchored by content and storytelling. A girl can understand what role Barbie is playing, what the other characters are doing, and how they interrelate. That\\'s a much richer level of story that leads to a richer level of play.\" The strategy worked as U.S. Barbie sales, led by the princess line, \"increased by two percent in 2006, saving Mattel\\'s bottom line at a time when its worldwide share of the toy market was declining.\" Within the films, Mattel included performances by well-known companies and orchestras, such as the London Symphony Orchestra, the Czech Philharmonic and the New York City Ballet. These associations could have been included as an enrichment strategy on behalf of Mattel\\'s marketing team to help the films be seen as educational.\\nIn the midst of the films, Canadian animation studio, Arc Productions, Inc., which was just renamed from Starz Animation Toronto (originally Daniel Krech Productions (DKP) and DKP Studios) and had new-consortium ownership and structural revamp, produced the first non-Barbie-film production for Mattel in 2011, a web series called Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse which debuted on the official Barbie website and YouTube on January 11, 2012 and concluded on November 27, 2015. The web series later spawned two television specials which were broadcast in the U.S. on Nickelodeon. Impressed, Mattel gave them four Barbie films to produce while enlisting them as the third production partner after Mainframe Studios (at the time known as \"Rainmaker Entertainment\") and Technicolor.\\nIsraeli animation studio, Snowball Studios, with support from the Jerusalem Film and Television Fund, produced another web series, this time created by Nickelodeon alum Julia Pistor, for Mattel Playground Productions known as Barbie: Dreamtopia. This series of 2-minute to 4-minute shorts launched on May 21, 2016 by Mattel\\'s then-newest division, Mattel Creations, on YouTube\\'s affiliate platform, YouTube Kids. The web shorts series later spawned an eponymous television film (distributed by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment and was broadcast on television in over 5 countries and regions/territories), one web-based special and a 26-episode web series – therefore invoking the first web-exclusive Barbie media franchise. This would be the catalyst for scholars and enthusiasts alike to notice Mattel heavily invested and involved in releasing more related Barbie web series and miniseries bundles on YouTube and its variants; YouTube Kids and YouTube Shorts.\\nThrough the short video bundles on YouTube, Mattel also provided a platform for Barbie to give its audience a look into her fictional life while trying to educate them along the way. With a YouTube channel having over 11 million subscribers, Mattel introduced Barbie as a YouTuber through a web series called Barbie Vlogger (or Barbie Vlogs), uploading its first video on June 19, 2015. Julia Pistor, who worked on the series as an executive producer and writer, stated: \"Barbie is conscious of language and words; she talks about intention and she\\'s self-reflective. While we might use words that kids sometimes need to look up, we try to be true to Barbie being a 17-year-old influencer.\" By giving a self-reflective nature to Barbie\\'s character, this would allow her to discuss difficult topics (such as mental health and racism) in such a way that it inspires its audience to think about and discuss those topics as well.With the success of its online platforms, Mattel would continue to produce web series and mini-series on YouTube and its variants. Beginning with Barbie: Dolphin Magic in 2017, the media franchise as a whole moved over to streaming media services, primarily Netflix, but also including Amazon Prime Video, Google Play and Apple TV+, with Mattel still maintaining the possibility of linear television broadcast agreements. In addition, Mattel signed an agreement on May 1, 2020, with Arts Music, Inc., a then-newest record label of Warner Music Group, to make thousands of songs from their brand portfolio – including Barbie – available through online music streaming services. The agreement began taking effect a week later when the soundtrack albums tied to their related productions are made available through WMG\\'s distribution label, ADA Worldwide. Mattel would extend its partnership with Netflix on October 21, 2022, 4 days before the American debut of the franchise\\'s inaugural interactive \"special\", Barbie: Epic Road Trip, which would also see the pre-2017 film catalogue previously held by Universal made available occasionally through the streaming service.\\n\\n\\n== Films ==\\n\\nAfter numerous video game releases in the 1990s and the rise of home video marketing, Mattel partnered with Canadian company, Mainframe Entertainment, (currently Mainframe Studios) to produce its first computer-animated feature-length film, Barbie in the Nutcracker, based on E. T. A. Hoffmann\\'s classic tale and Tchaikovsky\\'s accompanying ballet music, for a 2001 release. Mainframe continued to produce the majority of films in the series. The first decade was dominated by films based on pre-existing stories/tales, including Brothers Grimm\\'s fairy tales: Rapunzel and The Twelve Dancing Princesses, Tchaikovsky\\'s Swan Lake ballet, Charles Dickens\\' A Christmas Carol, Hans Christian Andersen\\'s Thumbelina and Alexandre Dumas\\' The Three Musketeers.The second film in the series, Barbie as Rapunzel, saw the debut of the film series on American television via Nickelodeon as television specials. For the home video formats, the release of the series on VHS ceased in 2006 after The Barbie Diaries following a general gradual decline in the use of the format and the transfer of distribution duties for the series to Universal in favor of solely the DVD releases. The Blu-ray and digital copies and the digital copies (branded as \"Digital HD\") were introduced to accompany the DVD with the release of Barbie in the Pink Shoes in 2013.Due to the popularity of the 2004 film Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper (based on Mark Twain\\'s famous novel), a remake was released in 2012 entitled Barbie: The Princess & the Popstar, which itself inspired two films with a more modern look: Barbie in Rock \\'N Royals in 2015 and Barbie: Princess Adventure in 2020.\\nThe success of the first three films (Barbie in the Nutcracker, Barbie as Rapunzel and Barbie of Swan Lake) led to the princess-themed lineup in the series, releasing its original princess film Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus in 2005. The first original film in the franchise, Barbie: Fairytopia, spawned the first-in-series franchise made up of two sequels (Barbie Fairytopia: Mermaidia in 2006 and Barbie Fairytopia: Magic of the Rainbow in 2007) and two spin-offs (Barbie: Mariposa in 2008 and its sequel, Barbie: Mariposa & the Fairy Princess, in 2013).\\nStarting with Barbie in A Mermaid Tale in early 2010, the film series moved away from the classic princess and fairy stories to focus on more modern themes like fashion, music, and on stories revolving around Barbie\\'s friends, family and careers. Barbie: Video Game Hero, the 35th film entry released in early 2017, marked the last time a Barbie film both aired on American television and released on home video formats. In 2017, the film series was put on hiatus after Barbie: Dolphin Magic, which served as the pilot to the inaugural television show in the franchise, Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, in Mattel\\'s attempt to focus on expanding the franchise to other audiovisual media formats. Mattel later revamped the films in 2020 as animated \"specials\", beginning with the musical, Barbie: Princess Adventure.Below is the full official computer-animated films in the media franchise:\\n\\n\\n== Live-action film ==\\n\\nA live-action adaptation of the toy line from Mattel Films in association with LuckyChap Entertainment and Heyday Films was released on July 21, 2023 by Warner Bros. having wrapped on July 15, 2022. The film was directed by Greta Gerwig who co-wrote the screenplay with Noah Baumbach and stars an ensemble cast led by Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken.\\n\\n\\n== Animated specials ==\\nBefore the films and the video games, Mattel released two animated television specials in 1987. Another animated special was released on February 1, 2023, on YouTube to complement a doll line exclusively aimed at preschoolers.\\n\\nBarbie and the Rockers: Out of This World, a 1987 animated TV special created by DIC Animation City with Saban Productions and featuring Barbie as the leader of a rock band.

It then spawned one 44-minute TV special (which aired on television in 5 countries/regions/territories), one web-based special and an initially-exclusive YouTube Kids series with 26 episodes. The latter was made available later on YouTube from November 5, 2017, to April 1, 2018, and aired as an actual TV series in over 6 countries.\\nBarbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, the inaugural TV series in the franchise released between May 3, 2018, and April 12, 2020, on Netflix in the U.S. It consisted of 52 episodes over 5 \"season\" episode bundles and aired as an actual TV series in over 8 countries.\\nBarbie\\'s Dreamworld, a YouTube-exclusive web series franchise created by Ireland-based Relish Studios that began on January 25, 2021, and is composed of several different miniseries, including Barbie: Return to Dreamtopia and Barbie and the Nutcracker among others.\\nBarbie: It Takes Two, the second TV series in the franchise released in two installments on Netflix in the United States; 13 episodes on April 8 and another 13 on October 1, both in 2022.

Workout with Barbie, a 1992 30-minute direct-to-video workout tape, featuring Barbie in stop-motion animation by Will Vinton Productions and teaching dance aerobics to real girls.\\nToy Story, a Disney-Pixar film franchise that started in 1995 and featuring Barbie (and later Ken) as supporting characters from Toy Story 2 onwards and its 2011 short film Hawaiian Vacation.\\nMy Scene, a discontinued franchise launched by Mattel in 2002 and featuring Barbie in its web series and in all of its films, namely: Jammin\\' in Jamaica and Masquerade Madness in 2004 and My Scene Goes Hollywood in 2005.\\nKelly Dream Club, a 2002 direct-to-video animated series and featuring Barbie as a supporting character to her younger sister, Kelly (renamed Chelsea in 2011).\\n\\n\\n== Cancelled projects ==\\nThe television specials released in 1987, Barbie and the Rockers: Out of this World and Barbie and the Sensations: Rockin\\' Back to Earth, were originally pitched as pilot episodes for a Barbie animated series that never materialized owing to the break-down in negotiations between DIC Entertainment and Mattel. The project eventually emerged with a whole new set of characters as Hasbro\\'s Maxie\\'s World in 1988.In an earlier version of the first Toy Story film, Barbie supposed to have a pivotal role. However, Mattel did not authorize her use to Pixar, as they feared the film would not be successful. Additionally, they wanted to maintain Barbie\\'s neutrality wherein every girl who bought a Barbie doll could imagine her as they wanted, rather than as she was portrayed in a particular film. After the success of the first film, multiple Barbie dolls had small roles in Toy Story 2, before the debut of the franchise\\'s definitive iteration in the second sequel.The 1999 short film commercial, Barbie as Sleeping Beauty, which was released on Nickelodeon as a tie-in to a doll line and video game of the same name, was originally pitched to be a full-length film. At the peak of classic princess-themed films in the 2000s, Mattel continued to pitch the idea of adapting the fairy tale based on the ballet, completing the adaptations of all three Tchaikovsky\\'s ballets into the franchise. However, it was scrapped without any disclosure on the status of its development while doll lines were released on multiple occasions. Although the reason behind the cancellation is closely linked to The Walt Disney Company being granted to trademark the name \"Princess Aurora\" and included the acquisition of some of the music (also based on the ballet) for its film.\\n\\n\\n== Upcoming projects ==\\nStarting with the interactive special film Barbie: Epic Road Trip on October 25, 2022, Mattel signed a long-term deal or contract extension with Netflix to make available the pre-2017 film catalogue previously held by Universal Pictures occasionally on the service and also co-produce upcoming projects which include exclusive animated films, specials and shows based on Barbie, while still maintaining the possibility of linear television broadcast agreements and YouTube engagements.Mattel published its upcoming projects on February 16, 2023, that was made available through this link which included a list of more Barbie content, as follows:\\n\\n\\n== Timeline of media appearances ==\\nThe earliest appearance of Barbie as a media character is her role in the 1987 TV specials where she was voiced by Sharon Lewis. She was voiced by Jodi Benson during her appearances in the Toy Story film franchise. In the Barbie lead-role films, she was voiced by Kelly Sheridan in 27 films altogether. Sheridan was initially succeeded by Diana Kaarina beginning with Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale in 2010, but returned to the role 2 years later with Barbie in A Mermaid Tale 2 and stayed put until Mattel announced Erica Lindbeck as her successor from 2016. The film series was put on a hiatus in 2017 for the shift in focus to the TV series, Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, where America Young would replace Lindbeck as the vocal provider for Barbie ahead of the film series resumption in 2020.

       " Document(page_content='Barbie is a fashion doll created by American businesswoman Ruth Handler, manufactured by American toy company Mattel and launched in 1959. The toy is the figurehead of the Barbie brand that includes a range of fashion dolls and accessories. Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over six decades. Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company\\'s largest and most profitable line. The brand has expanded into a multimedia franchise since the late 1980s, including video games, computer-animated films, and a live-action film.\\nBarbie and her male counterpart, Ken, have been described as the two most popular dolls in the world. Since its launch, Barbie has transformed the toy business in affluent communities globally by becoming a vehicle for the sale of related merchandise (accessories, clothes, friends and relatives of Barbie, etc.). Writing for Journal of Popular Culture in 1977, Don Richard Cox noted that Barbie has a significant impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale lifestyle that can be shared with affluent friends.Sales of Barbie dolls declined sharply from 2014 to 2016. In 2020, Mattel sold $1.35 billion worth of Barbie dolls and accessories, and this was their best sales growth in two decades. This is an increase from the $950 million the brand sold during 2017. According to MarketWatch, the release of the 2023 film Barbie is expected to create \"significant growth\" for the brand until at least 2030. As well as reinvigorated sales, the release of the film has triggered a fashion trend known as \"Barbiecore\".\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nRuth Handler watched her daughter Barbara play with paper dolls, and noticed that she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children\\'s toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing that there could be a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel\\'s directors.During a trip to Europe in 1956 with her children Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli. The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a satirical comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper Bild. The Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately.Upon her return to the United States, Handler redesigned the doll (with help from local inventor-designer Jack Ryan) and the doll was given a new name, Barbie, after Handler\\'s daughter Barbara. The doll made its debut at the American International Toy Fair in New York City on March 9, 1959. This date is also used as Barbie\\'s official birthday.\\n\\nThe first Barbie doll wore a black-and-white zebra striped swimsuit and signature topknot ponytail, and was available as either a blonde or brunette. The doll was marketed as a \"Teen-age Fashion Model\", with her clothes created by Mattel fashion designer Charlotte Johnson. The first Barbie dolls were manufactured in Japan, with their clothes hand-stitched by Japanese homeworkers. Around 350,000 Barbie dolls were sold during the first year of production.\\nLouis Marx and Company sued Mattel in March 1961. After licensing Lilli, they claimed that Mattel had \"infringed on Greiner & Hausser\\'s patent for Bild-Lilli\\'s hip joint\", and also claimed that Barbie was \"a direct take-off and copy\" of Bild-Lilli. The company additionally claimed that Mattel \"falsely and misleadingly represented itself as having originated the design\". Mattel counter-claimed and the case was settled out of court in 1963. In 1964, Mattel bought Greiner & Hausser\\'s copyright and patent rights for the Bild-Lilli doll for $21,600.Ruth Handler believed that it was important for Barbie to have an adult appearance, and early market research showed that some parents were unhappy about the doll\\'s chest, which had distinct breasts. Barbie\\'s appearance has been changed many times, most notably in 1971 when the doll\\'s eyes were adjusted to look forwards rather than having the demure sideways glance of the original model. This would be the last adjustment Ruth would make to her own creation as, three years later, she and her husband Elliot were removed from their posts at Mattel after an investigation found them guilty of issuing false and misleading financial reports.Barbie was one of the first toys to have a marketing strategy based extensively on television advertising, which has been copied widely by other toys. In 2006, it was estimated that over a billion Barbie dolls had been sold worldwide in over 150 countries, with Mattel claiming that three Barbie dolls are sold every second.The standard range of Barbie dolls and related accessories are manufactured to approximately 1/6 scale, which is also known as playscale. The standard dolls are approximately 11+1⁄2 inches (29 cm) tall.\\n\\n\\n== Appearances in media ==\\n\\nSince the mid-to-late 1980s, Barbie-branded products included not only the range of dolls with their clothes and accessories, but also a large range of branded goods such as books, apparel, cosmetics, video games and audiovisual content. Barbie is well known for her appearance as a virtual actress in a series of computer-animated feature films starting with Barbie in the Nutcracker in 2001, which were distributed on home video formats and broadcast on Nickelodeon in the United States (and globally) until 2017. Since 2017, they have been revamped as streaming television films, branded as animated \"specials\" and released through streaming services, primarily on Netflix.As at the release of the film Barbie in the Pink Shoes on February 26, 2013, the film series have sold over 110 million units globally. Before the films, the brand had two television specials released in 1987 in response to the rise of digital media at that time; Barbie and the Rockers: Out of This World and its sequel. Since 2012, she has appeared in several television and web series; including Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse, Barbie: Dreamtopia, Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures and Barbie: It Takes Two and as a supporting character in Pixar\\'s Toy Story films and the My Scene media franchise. In 2015, Barbie began appearing as a vlogger on YouTube called Barbie Vlogger where she talks about her fictional life, fashion, friends and family, and even charged topics such as mental health and racism. She is portrayed by Australian actress Margot Robbie in a live-action film adaptation released on 21 July 2023 by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Fictional biography ==\\n\\nBarbie\\'s full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. In a series of novels published by Random House in the 1960s, her parents\\' names are given as George and Margaret Roberts from the fictional town of Willows, Wisconsin. In the Random House novels, Barbie attended Willows High School; while in the Generation Girl books, published by Golden Books in 1999, she attended the fictional Manhattan International High School in New York City (based on the real-life Stuyvesant High School).She has an on-off romantic relationship with her then-boyfriend Ken (full name \"Kenneth Sean Carson\"), who first appeared in 1961. A news release from Mattel in February 2004 announced that Barbie and Ken had decided to split up, but in February 2006, they were hoping to rekindle their relationship after Ken had a makeover. In 2011, Mattel launched a campaign for Ken to win Barbie\\'s affections back. The pair officially reunited in Valentine\\'s Day 2011. At the release of Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures in 2018, the pair are seen as just friends or next-door neighbors.\\nMattel has created a range of companions and relatives for Barbie. She has three younger sisters: Skipper, Stacie, and Chelsea (named Kelly until 2011). Her sisters have co-starred in many entries of the Barbie film series, starting with Barbie & Her Sisters in A Pony Tale from 2013. \\'Retired\\' members of Barbie\\'s family included Todd (twin brother to Stacie), Krissy (a baby sister), and Francie (cousin). Barbie\\'s friends include Hispanic Teresa, Midge, African American Christie, and Steven (Christie\\'s boyfriend). Barbie was also friendly with Blaine, an Australian surfer, during her split with Ken in 2004.Barbie has had over 40 pets including cats and dogs, horses, a panda, a lion cub, and a zebra. She has owned a wide range of vehicles, including pink Beetle and Corvette convertibles, trailers, and Jeeps. She also holds a pilot\\'s license, and operates commercial airliners in addition to serving as a flight attendant. Barbie\\'s careers are designed to show that women can take on a variety of roles in life, and the doll has been sold with a wide range of titles including Miss Astronaut Barbie (1965), Doctor Barbie (1988), and Nascar Barbie (1998).\\n\\n\\n== Legacy and influence ==\\nBarbie has become a cultural icon and has been given honors that are rare in the toy world. In 1974, a section of Times Square in New York City was renamed Barbie Boulevard for a week. The Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris at the Louvre held a Barbie exhibit in 2016. The exhibit featured 700 Barbie dolls over two floors as well as works by contemporary artists and documents (newspapers, photos, video) that contextualize Barbie.In 1986, the artist Andy Warhol created a painting of Barbie. The painting sold at auction at Christie\\'s, London for $1.1 million. In 2015, The Andy Warhol Foundation then teamed up with Mattel to create an Andy Warhol Barbie.Outsider artist Al Carbee took thousands of photographs of Barbie and created countless collages and dioramas featuring Barbie in various settings. Carbee was the subject of the 2013 feature-length documentary Magical Universe. Carbee\\'s collage art was presented in the 2016 Barbie exhibit at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris in the section about visuals artists who have been inspired by Barbie.\\nIn 2013, in Taiwan, the first Barbie-themed restaurant called \"Barbie Café\" opened under the Sinlaku group.\\nThe Economist has emphasized the importance of Barbie to children\\'s imagination:From her early days as a teenage fashion model, Barbie has appeared as an astronaut, surgeon, Olympic athlete, downhill skier, aerobics instructor, TV news reporter, vet, rock star, doctor, army officer, air force pilot, summit diplomat, rap musician, presidential candidate (party undefined), baseball player, scuba diver, lifeguard, fire-fighter, engineer, dentist, and many more. [...] When Barbie first burst into the toy shops, just as the 1960s were breaking, the doll market consisted mostly of babies, designed for girls to cradle, rock and feed. By creating a doll with adult features, Mattel enabled girls to become anything they want.\\nOn September 7, 2021, following the debut of the streaming television film Barbie: Big City, Big Dreams on Netflix, Barbie joined forces with Grammy Award-nominated music producer, songwriter, singer and actress Ester Dean and Girls Make Beats – an organization dedicated to expanding the female presence of music producers, DJs and audio engineers – to inspire more girls to explore a future in music production.\\n\\n\\n=== Mattel Theme Park ===\\nIn 2023, Mattel broke ground on a theme park near Phoenix, Arizona. The park is to open in 2024 and highlights Mattel\\'s toys, including a Barbie Beach House, A Thomas & Friends themed ride, and a Hot Wheels go-kart race track. The theme park will take place at the VAI Resort complex, located 15 miles (24 km) west of Phoenix, Arizona.\\n\\n\\n=== 50th anniversary ===\\nIn 2009, Barbie celebrated her 50th birthday. The celebrations included a runway show in New York for the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. The event showcased fashions contributed by fifty well-known haute couturiers including Diane von Fürstenberg, Vera Wang, Calvin Klein, Bob Mackie, and Christian Louboutin.\\n\\n\\n=== Barbie Dream Gap Project ===\\nIn 2019, Mattel launched the \"Barbie Dream Gap Project\" to raise awareness of the phenomenon known as the \"Dream Gap\": beginning at the age of five, girls begin to doubt their own intelligence, where boys do not. This leads to boys pursuing careers requiring a higher intelligence, and girls being underrepresented in those careers. As an example, in the U.S., 33% of sitting judges are female. This statistic inspired the release of Judge Barbie in four different skin tones and hairstyles with judge robes and a gavel accessory.\\n\\n\\n=== Thank You Heroes ===\\nIn May 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mattel announced a new line of career dolls modeled after the first responders and essential workers of 2020. For every doll purchased, Mattel donated a doll to the First Responders Children\\'s Foundation.\\n\\n\\n=== Habitat for Humanity ===\\nIn February 2022, Mattel celebrated its 60-year anniversary of the Barbie Dreamhouse by partnering with Habitat for Humanity International. Mattel committed to taking on 60 projects, including new construction, home preservation, and neighborhood revitalization.\\n\\n\\n=== Bad influence concerns ===\\nIn July 1992, Mattel released Teen Talk Barbie, which spoke a number of phrases including \"Will we ever have enough clothes?\", \"I love shopping!\", and \"Wanna have a pizza party?\" Each doll was programmed to say four out of 270 possible phrases, so that no two given dolls were likely to be the same (the number of possible combinations is 270!/(266!4!) = 216,546,345). One of these 270 phrases was \"Math class is tough!\", which led to criticism from the American Association of University Women; about 1.5% of all the dolls sold said the phrase. The doll was often erroneously misattributed in the media as having said \"Math is hard!\" In October 1992, Mattel announced that Teen Talk Barbie would no longer say \"Math class is tough!\", and offered a swap to anyone who owned a doll that did.In 2002, Mattel introduced a line of pregnant Midge (and baby) dolls, but this Happy Family line was quickly pulled from the market due to complaints that she promoted teen pregnancy, though by that time, Barbie\\'s friend Midge was supposed to be a married adult.In September 2003, the Middle Eastern country of Saudi Arabia outlawed the sale of Barbie dolls and franchises, stating that they did not conform to the ideals of Islam. The Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice warned, \"Jewish Barbie dolls, with their revealing clothes and shameful postures, accessories and tools are a symbol of decadence to the perverted West. Let us beware of her dangers and be careful.\" The 2003 Saudi ban was temporary. In Muslim-majority nations, there is an alternative doll called Fulla, which was introduced in November 2003 and is equivalent to Barbie, but is designed specifically to represent traditional Islamic values. Fulla is not manufactured by Mattel (although Mattel still licenses Fulla dolls and franchises for sale in certain markets), and (as of January 2021) the \"Jewish\" Barbie brand is still available in other Muslim-majority countries including Egypt and Indonesia. In Iran, the Sara and Dara dolls, which were introduced in March 2002, are available as an alternative to Barbie, even though they have not been as successful.In November 2014, Mattel received criticism over the book I Can Be a Computer Engineer, which depicted Barbie as being inept at computers and requiring that her two male friends complete all of the necessary tasks to restore two laptops after she accidentally infects her and her sister\\'s laptop with a malware-laced USB flash drive. Critics complained that the book was sexist, as other books in the I Can Be... series depicted Barbie as someone who was competent in those jobs and did not require outside assistance from others. Mattel later removed the book from sale on Amazon in response to the criticism, and the company released a \"Computer Engineer Barbie\" doll who was a game programmer rather than designer.\\n\\n\\n== Diversity ==\\n\\n\"Colored Francie\" made her debut in 1967, and she is sometimes described as the first African-American Barbie doll. However, she was produced using the existing head molds for the white Francie doll and lacked distinct African characteristics other than dark skin. The first African-American doll in the Barbie range is usually regarded as Christie, who made her debut in 1968. Black Barbie was launched in 1980 but still had Caucasian features. In 1990, Mattel created a focus group with African-American children and parents, early childhood specialists, and clinical psychologist, Darlene Powell Hudson. Instead of using the same molds for the Caucasian Barbies, new ones were created. In addition, facial features, skin tones, hair texture, and names were all altered. The body shapes looked different, but the proportions were the same to ensure clothing and accessories were interchangeable. In September 2009, Mattel introduced the So In Style range, which was intended to create a more realistic depiction of African-American people than previous dolls.\\nStarting in 1980, it produced Hispanic dolls, and later came models from across the globe. For example, in 2007, it introduced \"Cinco de Mayo Barbie\" wearing a ruffled red, white, and green dress (echoing the Mexican flag). Hispanic magazine reports that:[O]ne of the most dramatic developments in Barbie\\'s history came when she embraced multi-culturalism and was released in a wide variety of native costumes, hair colors and skin tones to more closely resemble the girls who idolized her. Among these were Cinco De Mayo Barbie, Spanish Barbie, Peruvian Barbie, Mexican Barbie and Puerto Rican Barbie. She also has had close Hispanic friends, such as Teresa. Professor Emilie Rose Aguilo-Perez argued that over time, Mattel shifted from ambiguous Hispanic presentations in their dolls to one that is more assertive in its \"Latinx\" marketing and product labeling.Mattel has responded to criticisms pointing to a lack of diversity in the line. In 2016, Mattel expanded the So In Style line to include seven skin tones, twenty-two eye colors, and twenty-four hairstyles. Part of the reason for this change was due to declining sales. The brand now offers over 22 skin tones, 94 hair colors, 13 eye colors and five body types.Mattel teamed up with Nabisco to launch a cross-promotion Barbie doll with Oreo cookies in 1997 and 2001. While the 1997 release of the doll was only released in a white version, for the 2001 release Mattel manufactured both a white and a black version. The 2001 release Barbie Oreo School Time Fun was marketed as someone with whom young girls could play after class and share \"America\\'s favorite cookie\". Critics argued that in the African American community, Oreo is a derogatory term meaning that the person is \"black on the outside and white on the inside\", like the chocolate sandwich cookie itself.In May 1997, Mattel introduced Share a Smile Becky, a doll in a pink wheelchair. Kjersti Johnson, a 17-year-old high school student in Tacoma, Washington with cerebral palsy, pointed out that the doll would not fit into the elevator of Barbie\\'s $100 Dream House. Mattel announced that it would redesign the house in the future to accommodate the doll.\\n\\n\\n== Role model Barbies ==\\nIn March 2018, in time for International Women\\'s Day, Mattel unveiled the \"Barbie Celebrates Role Models\" campaign with a line of 17 dolls, informally known as \"sheroes\", from diverse backgrounds \"to showcase examples of extraordinary women\". Mattel developed this collection in response to mothers concerned about their daughters having positive female role models. Dolls in this collection include Frida Kahlo, Patti Jenkins, Chloe Kim, Nicola Adams, Ibtihaj Muhammad, Bindi Irwin, Amelia Earhart, Misty Copeland, Helene Darroze, Katherine Johnson, Sara Gama, Martyna Wojciechowska, Gabby Douglas, Guan Xiaotong, Ava Duvernay, Yuan Yuan Tan, Iris Apfel, Ashley Graham and Leyla Piedayesh. In 2020, the company announced a new release of \"shero\" dolls, including Paralympic champion Madison de Rozario, and world four-time sabre champion Olga Kharlan. In July 2021, Mattel released a Naomi Osaka Barbie doll as a part of the \\'Barbie Role Model\\' series. Osaka originally partnered with Barbie two years earlier. A month earlier, a Julie Bishop doll was released to acknowledge the former Australian politician, as was one for general practitioner Kirby White for her work during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. In August 2021 a Barbie modelled after European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti was released.\\n\\n\\n== Collecting ==\\nMattel estimates that there are well over 100,000 avid Barbie collectors. Ninety percent are women, at an average age of 40, purchasing more than twenty Barbie dolls each year. Forty-five percent of them spend upwards of $1000 a year.\\nVintage Barbie dolls from the early years are the most valuable at auction, and while the original Barbie was sold for $3.00 in 1959, a mint boxed Barbie from 1959 sold for $3552.50 on eBay in October 2004. On September 26, 2006, a Barbie doll set a world record at auction of £9,000 sterling (US$17,000) at Christie\\'s in London. The doll was a Barbie in Midnight Red from 1965 and was part of a private collection of 4,000 Barbie dolls being sold by two Dutch women, Ietje Raebel and her daughter Marina.In recent years, Mattel has sold a wide range of Barbie dolls aimed specifically at collectors, including porcelain versions, vintage reproductions, and depictions of Barbie as a range of characters from film and television series such as The Munsters and Star Trek. There are also collector\\'s edition dolls depicting Barbie dolls with a range of different ethnic identities. In 2004, Mattel introduced the Color Tier system for its collector\\'s edition Barbie dolls including pink, silver, gold, and platinum, depending on how many of the dolls are produced. In 2020, Mattel introduced the Dia De Los Muertos collectible Barbie doll, the second collectible released as part of the company\\'s La Catrina line which was launched in 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Parodies and lawsuits ==\\nBarbie has frequently been the target of parody:  \\n\\nMattel sued artist Tom Forsythe over a 1999 series of photographs called Food Chain Barbie in which Barbie winds up in a blender. Mattel lost the lawsuit and was forced to pay Forsythe\\'s legal costs.\\nOn the 25th episode of In Living Color, in December 1990, a Homey D. Clown sketch found HDC filling in for Santa Claus at a shopping mall. A little girl (Kelly Coffield) asks for a Malibu Barbie & Condominium playset; instead, \"Homey Claus\" gives her \"Compton Carlotta\" (a crude doll made of sticks and bottlecaps) with a slum-apartment (a milk carton). When the girl complains, Homey raises his signature blackjack and wishes her a Merry Christmas; taking the hint, she thanks him and hastily retires.\\nIn Latin America, notable controversies include a 2018 legal dispute involving the Panama-based Frida Kahlo Corporation\\'s allegations that Frida Kahlo\\'s great-niece in Mexico had wrongly licensed the Frida Kahlo trademark for the \"Frida Kahlo Barbie\" doll.\\nMattel filed a lawsuit in 2004 in the U.S. against Barbara Anderson-Walley, a Canadian business owner whose nickname is Barbie, over her website, which sells fetish clothing. The lawsuit was dismissed.\\nIn 2011, Greenpeace parodied Barbie, calling on Mattel to adopt a policy for its paper purchases that would protect the rainforest. Four months later, Mattel adopted a paper sustainability policy.\\nThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno displayed a \"Barbie Crystal Meth Lab\".\\nSaturday Night Live aired a parody of the Barbie commercials featuring \"Gangsta Bitch Barbie\" and \"Tupac Ken\". In 2002, the show also aired a skit, which starred Britney Spears as Barbie\\'s sister Skipper.\\nIn November 2002, a New York judge refused an injunction against the British-based artist Susanne Pitt, who had produced a \"Dungeon Barbie\" doll in bondage clothing.\\nAqua\\'s song \"Barbie Girl\" was the subject of the lawsuit Mattel v. MCA Records, which Mattel lost in 2002, with Judge Alex Kozinski saying that the song was a \"parody and a social commentary\".\\nTwo commercials by automobile company Nissan featuring dolls similar to Barbie and Ken was the subject of another lawsuit in 1997. In the first commercial, a female doll is lured into a car by a doll resembling G.I. Joe to the dismay of a Ken-like doll, accompanied by Van Halen\\'s \"You Really Got Me\". In the second commercial, the \"Barbie\" doll is saved by the \"G.I. Joe\" doll after she is accidentally knocked into a swimming pool by the \"Ken\" doll to Kiss\\'s \"Calling Dr. Love\". The makers of the commercial said that the dolls\\' names were Roxanne, Nick and Tad. Mattel claimed that the commercial did \"irreparable damage\" to its products, but settled.\\nIn 1999, Canadian nude model Barbie Doll Benson was involved in a trademark infringement case over her domain name, BarbieBenson.com.\\nIn 1993, a group calling itself the Barbie Liberation Organization secretly modified a group of Barbie dolls by implanting voice boxes from G.I. Joe dolls, then returning the Barbies to the toy stores from where they were purchased.\\nMalibu Stacy from The Simpsons 1994 episode \"Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy\".\\nSavior Barbie refers to a satirical Instagram account. Savior Barbie is depicted as being in Africa where she runs an NGO that provides drinking water to locals and makes sure to provide footage that depicts her glorious acts of goodness. The account is likely to have inspired others such as \"Hipster Barbie\" and \"Socality Barbie\".\\n\\n\\n== Competition from Bratz dolls ==\\nIn May 2001, MGA Entertainment launched the Bratz series of dolls, a move that gave Barbie her first serious competition in the fashion doll market. In 2004, sales figures showed that Bratz dolls were outselling Barbie dolls in the United Kingdom, although Mattel maintained that in terms of the number of dolls, clothes, and accessories sold, Barbie remained the leading brand. In 2005, figures showed that sales of Barbie dolls had fallen by 30% in the United States, and by 18% worldwide, with much of the drop being attributed to the popularity of Bratz dolls.In December 2006, Mattel sued MGA Entertainment for $1 billion, alleging that Bratz creator Carter Bryant was working for Mattel when he developed the idea for Bratz. On July 17, 2008, a federal jury agreed that the Bratz line was created by Carter Bryant while he was working for Mattel and that MGA and its chief executive officer Isaac Larian were liable for converting Mattel property for their own use and intentionally interfering with the contractual duties owed by Bryant to Mattel. On August 26, the jury found that Mattel would have to be paid $100 million in damages. On December 3, 2008, U.S. District Judge Stephen Larson banned MGA from selling Bratz. He allowed the company to continue selling the dolls until the winter holiday season ended. On appeal, a stay was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; the Court also overturned the District Court\\'s original ruling for Mattel, where MGA Entertainment was ordered to forfeit the entire Bratz brand.Mattel Inc. and MGA Entertainment Inc. returned to court on January 18, 2011, to renew their battle over who owns Bratz, which this time included accusations from both companies that the other side stole trade secrets. On April 21, 2011, a federal jury returned a verdict supporting MGA. On August 5, 2011, Mattel was also ordered to pay MGA $310 million for attorney fees, stealing trade secrets, and false claims rather than the $88.5 million issued in April.In August 2009, MGA introduced a range of dolls called Moxie Girlz, intended as a replacement for Bratz dolls.\\n\\n\\n== Effects on body image ==\\nFrom the start, some have complained that \"the blonde, plastic doll conveyed an unrealistic body image to girls.\"Criticisms of Barbie are often centered around concerns that children consider Barbie a role model and will attempt to emulate her. One of the most common criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a young woman, leading to a risk that girls who attempt to emulate her will become anorexic. Unrealistic body proportions in Barbie dolls have been connected to some eating disorders in children.A standard Barbie doll is 11.5 inches (29 cm) tall, giving a height of 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) at 1/6 scale. Barbie\\'s vital statistics have been estimated at 36 inches (91 cm) (chest), 18 inches (46 cm) (waist) and 33 inches (84 cm) (hips). According to research by the University Central Hospital in Helsinki, Finland, she would lack the 17 to 22 percent body fat required for a woman to menstruate. In 1963, the outfit \"Barbie Baby-Sits\" came with a book titled How to Lose Weight which advised: \"Don\\'t eat!\" The same book was included in another ensemble called \"Slumber Party\" in 1965 along with a pink bathroom scale permanently set at 110 pounds (50 kg), which would be underweight for a woman 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) tall. Mattel said that the waist of the Barbie doll was made small because the waistbands of her clothes, along with their seams, snaps, and zippers, added bulk to her figure. In 1997, Barbie\\'s body mold was redesigned and given a wider waist, with Mattel saying that this would make the doll better suited to contemporary fashion designs.In 2016, Mattel introduced a range of new body types: \\'tall\\', \\'petite\\', and \\'curvy\\', releasing them exclusively as part of the Barbie Fashionistas line. \\'Curvy Barbie\\' received a great deal of media attention and even made the cover of Time magazine with the headline \"Now Can We Stop Talking About My Body?\". Despite the curvy doll\\'s body shape being equivalent to a US size 4 in clothing, some children reportedly regarded her as \"fat\".Although Barbie had been criticized for its unrealistic-looking \"tall and petite\" dolls, the company has been offering more dolls set to more realistic standards in order to help promote a positive body image.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== \"Barbie syndrome\" ===\\n\"Barbie syndrome\" is a term that has been used to depict the desire to have a physical appearance and lifestyle representative of the Barbie doll. It is most often associated with pre-teenage and adolescent girls but is applicable to any age group or gender. A person with Barbie syndrome attempts to emulate the doll\\'s physical appearance, even though the doll has unattainable body proportions. This syndrome is seen as a form of body dysmorphic disorder and results in various eating disorders as well as an obsession with cosmetic surgery.Ukrainian model Valeria Lukyanova has received attention from the press, due in part to her appearance having been modified based on the physique of Barbie. She stated that she has only had breast implants and relies heavily on make up and contacts to alter her appearance. Similarly, Lacey Wildd, an American reality television personality frequently referred to as \"Million Dollar Barbie\", has also undergone 12 breast augmentation surgeries to become \"the extreme Barbie\".Jessica Alves, prior to coming out as transgender, underwent over £373,000 worth of cosmetic procedures to match the appearance of Barbie\\'s male counterpart, garnering her the nickname the \"Human Ken Doll\". These procedures have included multiple nose jobs, six pack ab implants, a buttock lift, and hair and chest implants. Sporting the same nickname, Justin Jedlica, the American businessman, has also received multiple cosmetic surgeries to enhance his Ken-like appearance.\\nIn 2006, researchers Helga Dittmar, Emma Halliwell, and Suzanne Ive conducted an experiment testing how dolls, including Barbie, affect self-image in young girls. Dittmar, Halliwell, and Ive gave picture books to girls age 5–8, one with photos of Barbie and the other with photos of Emme, a doll with more realistic physical features. The girls were then asked about their ideal body size. Their research found that the girls who were exposed to the images of Barbie had significantly lower self-esteem than the girls who had photos of Emme. However, Benjamin Radford noted that the answer may not be this simple since this research also showed that the age of the girl was a significant factor in the influence the doll had on her self esteem.\\n\\n\\n== Notable designers ==\\nKitty Black Perkins, creator of Black Barbie\\nCarol Spencer, Barbie fashion designer from 1963-1999\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBarbie (media franchise)\\nBarbenheimer\\nCreatable World\\nKitty Black Perkins\\nLammily - a crowd funded alternative developed by Nickolay Lamm\\nList of Barbie animated films\\nList of Barbie video games\\nMy Scene\\nSindy\\nSuperstar: The Karen Carpenter Story\\nThe Most Popular Girls in School\\nTotally Hair Barbie\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBest, Joel. \"Too Much Fun: Toys as Social Problems and the Interpretation of Culture\", Symbolic Interaction 21#2  (1998), pp. 197–212.

The toy is the figurehead of the Barbie brand that includes a range of fashion dolls and accessories. Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over six decades. Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company\\'s largest and most profitable line. The brand has expanded into a multimedia franchise since the late 1980s, including video games, computer-animated films, and a live-action film.\\nBarbie and her male counterpart, Ken, have been described as the two most popular dolls in the world. Since its launch, Barbie has transformed the toy business in affluent communities globally by becoming a vehicle for the sale of related merchandise (accessories, clothes, friends and relatives of Barbie, etc.). Writing for Journal of Popular Culture in 1977, Don Richard Cox noted that Barbie has a significant impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale lifestyle that can be shared with affluent friends.Sales of Barbie dolls declined sharply from 2014 to 2016. In 2020, Mattel sold $1.35 billion worth of Barbie dolls and accessories, and this was their best sales growth in two decades. This is an increase from the $950 million the brand sold during 2017. According to MarketWatch, the release of the 2023 film Barbie is expected to create \"significant growth\" for the brand until at least 2030. As well as reinvigorated sales, the release of the film has triggered a fashion trend known as \"Barbiecore\".', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Barbenheimer was an Internet phenomenon that began on social media before the simultaneous theatrical release of two blockbuster films, Barbie and Oppenheimer, on July 21, 2023, in the United States and several other countries. The word is a portmanteau of the films\\' titles. The contrast of Barbie—a fantasy comedy by Greta Gerwig about the fashion doll Barbie—and Oppenheimer—an epic biographical thriller by Christopher Nolan about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project, which developed the first nuclear weapons during World War II—prompted a comedic response from Internet users, including memes and merchandise. Polygon described the two films as \"extreme opposites\", and Variety called the phenomenon \"the movie event of the year\".The films\\' simultaneous release was an instance of counterprogramming. As their release date approached, instead of generating a rivalry, suggestions emerged to watch the films as a double feature—as well as what order to watch them—and cast members of both responded by encouraging audiences to watch the films on the same day. Celebrity participants included actor Tom Cruise, who purchased tickets to watch both while his latest film, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, was still playing in theaters.\\nBoth films received widespread critical acclaim and exceeded box-office expectations. While the phenomenon began as a joke about the two films\\' seemingly endless differences, some media commentators have pointed out similarities between them; both films have been analyzed as exploring existentialism and the theoretical notion of the Anthropocene, each has an Oscar-nominated director and screenwriter and a large ensemble cast, and both were produced by a husband-and-wife production company.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Release date dispute ===\\n\\nIn December 2020, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema, WarnerMedia, the then-parent company of Warner Bros. Pictures, announced it would release all 17 of its upcoming 2021 films exclusively on its streaming service, HBO Max, in what was nicknamed \"Project Popcorn\". This decision was heavily criticized the same month by director Christopher Nolan, whose films had been distributed by Warner Bros. since 2002\\'s Insomnia. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Nolan said, \"Some of our industry\\'s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.\" He also said that Warner Bros. \"[doesn\\'t] even understand what they\\'re losing\", and that the \"decision [made] no economic sense\". Warner Bros. eventually backed off from the streaming-exclusive releasing plan for their feature films in March 2021.Nevertheless, after Warner Bros.\\' initial plan, Nolan met with several rival studios, and announced in September 2021 that his next film, Oppenheimer, would be distributed by Universal Pictures instead of Warner. Conditions for making his next film with Universal included: a budget of $100 million, a marketing budget of equal size, creative control, 20% of first-dollar gross, a blackout period whereby the studio would not release another movie three weeks before or after release and, to ensure it would not land on a streaming service immediately, a 100-day theatrical window. The following month, Universal announced the July 21, 2023, release date for Oppenheimer. Warner Bros. had originally scheduled Coyote vs. Acme to be released on the same date of July 21, but in April 2022, the studio announced that the film Barbie would be released on that date instead, having it directly compete against Nolan\\'s film.Nolan\\'s disagreement with Warner was cited as the principal cause of this decision, with Insider speculating that the decision to release the long-in-development Barbie directly opposite Oppenheimer may have been revenge against Nolan for ending his collaboration with the company. The mid-July date was relevant, beginning with The Dark Knight and with the exception of Interstellar (which was released in early November 2014, as distributed by Paramount Pictures in the United States and Canada, and by Warner Bros. internationally) and Tenet (which was delayed from the original release date of July 17, 2020, following the COVID-19 pandemic), Nolan\\'s films have been released in mid-July. Newly appointed Warner Bros. heads Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy later stated that they wished to reconcile with Nolan; box office experts questioned why Warner refused to move Barbie\\'s release date if they wished to restore relations with Nolan.Nolan was reportedly annoyed by Warner Bros.\\' decision to schedule Barbie on the same date as Oppenheimer. Despite this, when asked by an Insider reporter whether his split with Warner was indeed the cause of Barbie\\'s release date, Nolan laughed and said he was \"not going to answer that question\", adding that theaters now have \"a crowded marketplace with a lot of different movies ..., and those of us who care about movies are thrilled about that\". When asked about the films sharing the same release date, Nolan told an IGN reporter that a \"crowded marketplace\" is \"here and that\\'s terrific\".\\n\\n\\n=== Counterprogramming ===\\nThe Barbenheimer phenomenon is an instance of counterprogramming, a marketing strategy in which a tonally different film is released on the same day as a major film to appeal to an underrepresented group. Universal successfully deployed counterprogramming as early as 2002, when it opened the dramedy About a Boy opposite the science-fiction blockbuster Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones. The former enjoyed the strongest opening for a British film that year, finishing with over $130 million.Men\\'s magazine GQ observed the phenomenon occurring in the holiday season, such as Avatar: The Way of Water and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish in 2022, and compared summer to an \"all-or-nothing bloodsport\". In 2022, counterprogramming occurred with the summer films Top Gun: Maverick and The Bob\\'s Burgers Movie, in which the latter is a smaller film than the former, allowing for such a dynamic.The release date of Barbie and Oppenheimer drew parallels to the same U.S. release date of the superhero film The Dark Knight—directed by Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan about DC Comics\\' Batman, and distributed by Warner Bros.—and the jukebox musical Mamma Mia!—based on the stage musical of the same name featuring the songs of ABBA, and distributed by Universal—on July 18, 2008. Actor Tom Cruise, producer and lead actor of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One which opened the week before the two films, fervently promoted his film over Oppenheimer and Barbie to erode Oppenheimer\\'s three-week IMAX exclusivity window, while using Barbie to show his film on non-IMAX screens.Barbenheimer has seen comparisons to the simultaneous release of the video game titles Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Doom Eternal on March 20, 2020, which prompted a similar online crossover phenomenon at the time.In light of Barbenheimer, other studios concocted similar events to their upcoming releases. This includes \"Saw Patrol\", named after Saw X and PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie to be released September 29, 2023, though this received a more mixed response.\\n\\n\\n==== Public reaction ====\\nThe first known use of the term \"Barbenheimer\" was in a post on Twitter dated April 15, 2022, by Matt Neglia, editor-in-chief of the entertainment awards website Next Best Picture. The post made fun of the fact that both films seemed to be constantly announcing new cast members. Neglia later said he did not remember writing the post.Use of the term gained pace in 2023, as internet users noted the juxtaposition of the films and posted memes on Twitter. Fan-made posters for Barbenheimer circulated online. Shirt designers on Etsy began creating merchandise based on the Barbenheimer phenomenon. Early versions of these shirts directly used the wordmarks of the films and placed them side-by-side, while later versions used a Barbie-inspired \"Barbenheimer\" wordmark. Several tweets referenced the Sherbet Homes in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, side-by-side homes noted for one\\'s black demeanor and the other\\'s pink appearance.Two Dallas video editors made US$14,400 selling Barbenheimer shirts. Businesses have also posted about the phenomenon; a Barnes & Noble store in Olympia, Washington, presented a \"Barbeinheimer [sic] Starter Pack\" on TikTok, accruing 30,000 likes.\\n\\n\\n=== Marketing ===\\nThe films\\' marketing differed greatly. Barbie\\'s marketing, estimated to cost $150 million to Oppenheimer\\'s $100 million, used a wide range of immersive partnerships and tie-in products. Oppenheimer took a more low-key approach, aiming to cultivate intrigue with trailers and an online countdown to the 78th anniversary of the first nuclear explosion.Barbie held a premiere on July 12, 2023, in London, where Oppenheimer held another the next day; on July 14, SAG-AFTRA, an American labor union of film, television, and voice actors, declared a strike action, effectively halting any promotional event that involved any member in the guild. Barbie star Margot Robbie showed her support in the action when questioned by a Sky News reporter at the film\\'s London event. Despite Oppenheimer\\'s London premiere being moved up an hour early, the cast of the film left during the screening in support of the strike. SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios \"duped\" the guild into accepting a 12-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films such as Barbie and Oppenheimer.\\n\\n\\n=== Double feature viewing ===\\nMany Hollywood personalities and Internet users have viewed the films as a double feature, with a debate on viewing order being part of the meme.Margot Robbie, who portrays the titular character in Barbie, suggested watching it, then Oppenheimer, and then Barbie again. President Barbie\\'s actor in Barbie, Issa Rae, said that \"If you see Oppenheimer last then you might be a bit of a psychopath.\" CNN Entertainment writer Scottie Andrew recommended watching Oppenheimer first and Barbie second, comparing it to \"saving dessert for after dinner\".\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Box office ===\\n\\n\\n==== Projections ====\\nGoing into their opening weekends, Barbie was projected to gross $90–120 million in its opening weekend, and Oppenheimer was projected to gross $45–50 million. Two weeks before their release, AMC Theatres announced that more than 20,000 AMC Stubs members had pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day, resulting in a 33% increase in double-feature tickets from July 7 to 10. On July 17, AMC announced 40,000 members had pre-ordered tickets. According to cinema chain Vue International, nearly one-fifth of people who bought a ticket for Oppenheimer also bought a ticket for Barbie.The Barbenheimer phenomenon helped boost box-office revenue, which was still recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and a slow seasonal film season.The New York Times called the films\\' dual opening weekend \"the last happy weekend for many months\", as the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes would likely delay the release of films expected to be award-season contenders.\\n\\n\\n==== Gross ====\\nBoth films exceeded box-office expectations. Barbie became the highest-grossing domestic release in Warner Bros history, surpassing Nolan\\'s The Dark Knight. In the United States and Canada, Barbie grossed $22.3 million in Thursday night previews, while Oppenheimer grossed $10.5 million. This was the first time two movies released in the same weekend have grossed more than $10 million each in their previews. Including previews, the films made $70.5 million and $33 million on their first days, respectively, which led to weekend projections being increased to $160 million and $77 million. The films went on to debut to $162 million and $82.4 million, respectively. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the films, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend (52% for Barbie and 27% for Oppenheimer) being for the two films, a total of 18.5 million people. Additionally, Oppenheimer made $4.98 million from audience members who saw the film because their desired Barbie showtime was sold out. IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond described the weekend as a paradigm shift, referring to Oppenheimer bringing in $35 million from 740 IMAX screens. Oppenheimer saw the second-largest opening not to top the domestic box office, falling short of Inside Out\\'s $90.4 million opening by a small margin. Barbie and Oppenheimer led the July 21–23 weekend to a total revenue of $310.8 million, making it the fourth-largest aggregate domestic weekend ever, behind the weekends led by the openings of Avengers: Endgame (April 26–28, 2019, $402 million), Avengers: Infinity War (April 27–29, 2018, $314 million), and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (December 18–20, 2015, $313 million).\\n\\n\\n=== Film industry reaction ===\\n\\nTom Cruise, whom director Steven Spielberg proclaimed \"saved Hollywood\\'s ass\" with the success of Top Gun: Maverick the previous year, referred to Barbie and Oppenheimer as a double feature in a Twitter post along with photographs of him and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie with tickets to the two films. Similarly, Gerwig and Barbie star Margot Robbie were featured in photographs on the Barbie Twitter holding up tickets to Oppenheimer, as well as Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. At the premiere of Air, actor and Oppenheimer star Matt Damon told Vanity Fair that audiences are \"allowed to go see two movies in a weekend\". Director Francis Ford Coppola called the box office success of both films \"a victory for cinema\".At the world premiere of Barbie in Los Angeles, Gerwig and Issa Rae praised the double feature concept. Rae said, \"I love that there\\'s solidarity though where people tried to pit us against one another but now it\\'s turned into like a double-feature situation\". In an interview with La Vanguardia, Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy endorsed the phenomenon, saying, \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that\\'s cinema\\'s gain.\" At the London premiere for Barbie, Robbie said she wants a Barbenheimer shirt signed by Murphy.\\n\\n\\n=== Japanese response ===\\nThe Barbenheimer phenomenon, when used insensitively, sparked negative reactions in Japan, where Oppenheimer is seen as a controversial film, and has not been screened. When the live-action Barbie film\\'s official Twitter account (@barbiethemovie) favorably reacted to image designs that incorporated the mushroom cloud of and fire from an atomic bomb and punning (\"It will be a blast\"), it was met with anger and intense disdain within Japan. This was attributed to Japan\\'s educational emphasis on the destruction caused by nuclear weapons, as the only country to have been attacked by them. As a result, mushroom clouds and atomic bombs were considered inappropriate for casual or comedic usage.The Japanese branch of Warner Bros. issued a statement of regret on July 31, 2023 (JST) through its own Twitter account for the Barbie film (@BarbieMovie_jp), condemning the actions of the U.S. headquarters and urging them to \"take appropriate action.\" On the night of July 31, 2023 (PST), Warner\\'s headquarters issued a statement to news outlets, writing that it regrets \"its recent insensitive social media engagement\", and the Barbie film\\'s American Twitter account reportedly began to delete the replies in question.\\n\\n\\n=== Analysis ===\\nThe Economist observed that the \"two films encapsulate some of the caprices of the modern movie industry\", with Barbie being an IP-driven film projected to gross twice as much (in its opening weekend) as Oppenheimer, a standalone film. The paper also concluded that, in the advent of the increased nuclear anxiety following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and developments around the nuclear arsenals of China and North Korea, audiences are less willing to see a realist drama film such as Oppenheimer than they are eager to see an escapist comedy film such as Barbie, recalling similar instances of the dynamic in American film history. Senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore opined that the Barbenheimer phenomenon was unprecedented, feeling that ordinarily, the simultaneous release of two significant films would have \"cannibalized\" each other, but in the case of Barbenheimer, would be \"additive and complementary\". He believes that the phenomenon would attract a wide demographic, with older audiences hearing about Oppenheimer through review pieces and listening to the radio, while Barbie would draw a big audience on its opening weekend because its \\'fear of missing out\\' factor \"is going to be off the charts\".Writing for FirstShowing, Alex Billington compared how philosophical both films were, citing concepts present in each such as existentialism, Marcel Proust, and how both protagonists discover truth similar to Plato\\'s Cave. Slavoj Žižek, in The New Statesman, argues that both films feature main characters that attempt to escape fantasy and uncover a deeper reality, only to discover that their reality itself is constituted in relation to fantasy.Though the Internet joke began as a reference to the two films\\' seeming differences, some writers have pointed out similarities between them, including that \"Nolan and Gerwig are both [Oscar-nominated] directors, both have huge ensemble casts of stars, and they are both produced by husband and wife production companies\". Writing for The Escapist, critic Darren Mooney also found similarities between the two films, noting that both \"are about the relationship that exists between imagination and reality, as well as about what happens when ideas begin to manifest themselves in the corporeal world. In both cases, the results are fundamentally terrifying, although the movies reach decidedly different conclusions.\" Sonia Rao of The Washington Post notes that the two films share a common notion: \"The corruptibility of men\". Also in the The Washington Post, Tyler Austin Harper wrote that both films explore the theoretical notion of the Anthropocene, the geological epoch defined by humanity\\'s impact: \"Despite their apparent differences, both Barbie and Oppenheimer tell the story of core ideas of the 20th century: accelerating militarism and unbounded consumption, ideas which might well outlive our species in the form of plastic and plutonium\\'s lingering traces across our fragile planet.\"Jake Coyle of the Associated Press analyzed the box office gross of Barbie and Oppenheimer and noted that their success may point to audiences wanting more originality in films, following \"flopbusters\" like The Flash and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, both of which became box-office bombs.Journalist Larissa Kuhnert from German newspaper Neues Deutschland attributed the success of the phenomenon to astroturfing. According to journalist Thomas Koch from the German magazine Wirtschaftswoche, the success of Barbenheimer is said to have been planned by Mattel Marketing.\\n\\n\\n=== Reviews ===\\nOf critics reviewing the double feature, an SFGate reviewer who watched Barbie first judged it to be the better film and \"kinda hope[d]\" Gerwig would make a film about Oppenheimer. An IndieWire reviewer who watched Oppenheimer first (with several audience members dressed in pink and one wearing a Barbenheimer T-shirt) said the films worked \"decently\" as a double feature. On the other hand, a reviewer in The Guardian who also watched Oppenheimer first compared the experience to whiplash and to \"having your mother\\'s funeral invaded by a flashmob of parking circus clowns\". In a paired review in The New Yorker that criticized both films, Anthony Lane found similarity in performances that, in his opinion, threaten to overshadow the starring roles: \"[J]ust as Downey [Robert Downey Jr., as Lewis Strauss] threatens to pull Nolan\\'s film out of orbit, so, in \"Barbie,\" does Gosling [Ryan Gosling, as Ken] attract a dangerous share of the dramatic energy\". The review also noted that in both films, characters describe the premise of the film as \"impossible\".\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n The dictionary definition of barbenheimer at Wiktionary', metadata={'title': 'Barbenheimer', 'summary': 'Barbenheimer was an Internet phenomenon that began on social media before the simultaneous theatrical release of two blockbuster films, Barbie and Oppenheimer, on July 21, 2023, in the United States and several other countries.

       " Document(page_content='\"Barbie World\" is a song by Trinidadian rapper Nicki Minaj and American rapper Ice Spice from Barbie: The Album, the soundtrack of the film Barbie (2023). It was released by Atlantic Records, 10K Projects, and Capitol Records as the soundtrack\\'s second single on June 23, 2023, and was serviced to United States radio on June 27, 2023. The song heavily samples the 1997 single \"Barbie Girl\" by Danish Europop band Aqua, who are credited as performers and co-writers in the song. \\n\"Barbie World\" debuted at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Minaj\\'s 23rd, Ice Spice\\'s fourth, and Aqua\\'s second top-ten hit. Elsewhere, the single also reached the top ten in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nIn 1997, Danish-Norwegian band Aqua released \"Barbie Girl\", a song about two fashion dolls manufactured by Mattel named Barbie and Ken. The song was a massive success, thrusting the band into worldwide fame. Per Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \"Barbie Girl\" was an \"inexplicable pop culture phenomenon\", and Bree Player of Marie Claire Australia wrote it helped solidify the Barbie doll as a cultural icon. However, Mattel reacted negatively to \"Barbie Girl\" and sued Aqua\\'s US label, MCA Records, claiming the band violated their trademark and the lyrics\\' sexually suggestive nature stained the company\\'s reputation as a child-friendly brand.Since the beginning of her career, rapper Nicki Minaj has made the Barbie doll a significant part of her public persona. A widely known aspect of her artistry is her use of alter egos, one of whom is named Harajuku Barbie. Through this alter ego, Minaj showcases her feminine, fashion-savvy side with wigs, makeup, and nails that are bright and vibrant in color. Her Barbie image extends to her fanbase\\'s name, the \"Barbz\", derived from Harajuku Barbie\\'s name. Mattel has interacted with Minaj once: the two worked on a custom-made Harajuku Barbie-inspired doll auctioned for a charity for people affected with HIV/AIDS.Making a live-action Barbie film had been an endeavor Mattel sought to pursue for over 10 years, with many failed tries. In another attempt, the company struck a partnership with Warner Bros. Pictures by early 2019 to create a film that would star actress Margot Robbie. Production began in March 2022; initial discussions for the soundtrack followed four months later. Barbie: The Album, executive produced by Mark Ronson, was to encompass several stylings of contemporary pop music, from dance and K-pop to drill and Reggaeton. Moises Mendez II of Time described many of the songs as \"tongue-in-cheek girl power pop\".\\n\\n\\n== Music and lyrics ==\\nThere are 16 songs on the soundtrack, and the third is named \"Barbie World\". It samples Aqua\\'s \"Barbie Girl\", looping the chorus\\'s vocals from the band\\'s lead singer, Lene Nystrøm. Making the song began with figuring out how to integrate the sample, so Ronson turned to producer RiotUSA to create a beat around it, though the plan was not in the script the film\\'s director, Greta Gerwig, had. Initially, in 2022, Nystrøm\\'s manager stated \"Barbie Girl\" would not be used on the film, to an indignant reaction from fans. Variety speculated bad relations between Mattel and MCA Records were the cause. Nevertheless, the team behind the soundtrack, including Robbie, were passionate for it to be included in some way. They were faced with a dilemma: whether to include \"Barbie Girl\" on the soundtrack directly, or to instead reimagine it. When asked why they chose the second, Ronson said: \"I don\\'t know, you\\'d have to ask Greta. But everything about this film is trying to be a reinvention or an evolution of what we think Barbie is, so maybe [the sampling] was a way of doing that.\"Minaj is one of the 19 musicians that appear on Barbie: The Album and one of the performers on \"Barbie World\". The team that curated the soundtrack knew she, by any means possible, had to have a song in the film. They considered her approval one of their highest priorities. Ronson, alongside Gerwig, deemed Minaj an \"obvious choice\" for artists to include in their \"dream list\" of potential collaborators due to her long-time association with the Barbie brand. He also alluded to her fanbase\\'s \"Barbz\" name as further solidifying their choice. In an interview with Music Week, Ronson remarked, \"there\\'s no way we can have a Barbie soundtrack without Nicki Minaj—the person who\\'s literally kept the term \\'Barbie\\' alive in music and pop culture for 15 years.\" At first, Minaj was reluctant to make a song for the team, rejecting several demos from the team. As she revealed in a red carpet interview, people have sent her samples of \"Barbie Girl\" on which they wanted her to rap for years, but she never liked any of them. She said every sample made her feel uncomfortable or gimmicky.Ronson and his team invited another rapper, Ice Spice, to contribute to \"Barbie World\". They had been eyeing her since she rose to fame with the single \"Munch (Feelin\\' U)\" in August 2022, considering her status as the \"most exciting new thing in music\" something that would prove useful for the soundtrack. RiotUSA, her long-time collaborator, connected her to Ronson after working on the sample. The three were slated to, on one evening, meet at a studio at 9 pm, so Ronson can show Ice Spice a 20-minute snippet of the film and she can send her verses. The viewings, according to Ronson, would help artists match the tone and theme of their lyrics to the scenes assigned to them. There was a conflict in schedule between him and other two: Ronson waited until around 11 pm for updates from them, to no response. He prepared for bed only to get a message shortly afterward, biking to the studio and meeting them by midnight. Whereas Ronson failed to convince Minaj to work on \"Barbie World\", he succeeded in doing so with Ice Spice, due to the two rappers\\' amicable work relationship.The final result is a drill and pop song that incorporates elements of Jersey club music. It combines syncopated percussion with loud bass drums, with uncredited contributions from Ronson, who played keys. In the words of Melissa Ruggieri of USA Today, a \"slithering beat that weaves in and out of its bass-heavy pulse\" makes up the production. The use of drums, apart from how \"Barbie World\" did not sound like a gimmick to Minaj, is another thing she cited as to why she was drawn to the song. She said: \"I just wanted it to have a dope drum, and so the one that they sent me, I loved!\" The song begins with back-and-forth rapping between Ice Spice (\"And I\\'m bad like the Barbie\") and Minaj (\"I\\'m a doll but I still wanna party\"). The two namedrop Jazzie, Stacie, and Nikki, three dolls who canonically are Barbie\\'s cousin, sister, and friend, respectively. The Nikki namedrop doubly acts as a reference to Minaj. Afterwards, Minaj raps, \"all of the Barbies is bad\". One of the lyrics, teased at the end of the film\\'s trailer, reads \"it\\'s Barbie, bitch, if you still in doubt\". As observed by Natalee Gilbert of XXL, Minaj came up with \"it\\'s Barbie, bitch\" as a way to say goodbye to people, influenced by her alter ego, Harajuku Barbie. Due to the sample, Aqua received performing and writing credits on the song.\\n\\n\\n== Release ==\\nIn April 2022, it was announced that the live-action Barbie film would be released on July 21, 2023. In May 2023, a second trailer for the film was released, which featured a snippet of a new song with vocals from Minaj. Media speculated the composition to be a remix of \"Barbie Girl\".  On May 25, Barbie: The Album, the soundtrack to the film, was announced. Minaj and fellow rapper Ice Spice were revealed among multiple artists to be performing new original material on the record. Following the tracklist release, it was confirmed that the new song was a collaboration between Minaj and Ice Spice, titled \"Barbie World\".On June 10, both rappers announced the song\\'s release date as June 23, 2023, marking the fourth single from the film\\'s soundtrack.  Minaj previewed \"Barbie World\" twice on her social media, on June 12 and 22. It marks the second collaboration between Minaj, Ice Spice, and producer RiotUSA, following the remix of \"Princess Diana\" (2023).\\n\\n\\n== Commercial performance ==\\n\\n\\n=== North America ===\\nIn the United States, \"Barbie World\" debuted at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 with 16.2 million streams, 37,000 digital downloads sold, and 4.7 million airplay audience—matching the peak of \"Barbie Girl\". With this, Minaj extended her record for the most top-ten entries by a female rapper (23), she also broke her tie with Eminem and Jay-Z to become the rapper with the third most top ten entries only behind Lil Wayne (25) and Drake (68).

The film premiered on Nickelodeon on March 6, 2005, and was released on VHS and DVD two days later. It was distributed internationally through Universal Pictures Video and Entertainment Rights.The fifth installment in the Barbie film series and the first to have an original storyline not based on existing material, the film follows Elina, a wingless flower fairy who goes on a journey to save the enchanted land of Fairytopia from the evil fairy Laverna. The film is followed by two sequels; Barbie: Mermaidia and Barbie Fairytopia: Magic of the Rainbow and two spin-offs; Barbie: Mariposa and Barbie: Mariposa & the Fairy Princess.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nIn the film, Barbie plays the role of Elina – a flower fairy who lives in the realm of Fairytopia with her puffball, Bibble. Unlike all other fairies, Elina does not have wings, which she is often ridiculed for. Elina and her friend Dandelion learn that one of Fairytopia\\'s guardians, Topaz, has supposedly been kidnapped. Elina returns to her flower home, Peony, in disbelief.\\nIn truth, Topaz really has been kidnapped by Laverna, the evil twin sister of Fairytopia\\'s benevolent ruler, the Enchantress. Laverna reveals that she incapacitated her sister with poison and plans to capture all seven of Fairytopia’s guardians. Meanwhile, Laverna’s minions will spread her mist-like formula all over Fairytopia, which will weaken all winged creatures. With no other options, the denizens of Fairytopia will turn to Laverna for a cure and crown her queen as a result.\\nIn the morning, Elina and Bibble awaken to see that Peony as well as all the other fairy homes in the meadow are sick from Laverna\\'s formula. Elina, Dandelion, and Bibble decide to seek help from the closest guardian, Azura. Upon entering a forest, Dandelion breathes some of Laverna\\'s formula and is forced to return home when she becomes unable to fly.\\nAfter being turned away when they ask to see Azura, Elina and Bibble sneak to Azura\\'s house, where she is discovered by Azura herself. Seeing a rainbow in Elina\\'s eye, Azura invites them inside. She explains that the rainbow in Elina\\'s eyes means she\\'s destined for great things, which Elina, who does not believe in herself, disagrees with. Azura tells her that all of Fairytopia is in trouble because of Laverna and in the morning she will leave to speak to a dryad named Dahlia, a former follower of Laverna; she then asks Elina to take care of her magic necklace.\\nIn the morning, as Azura is about to leave, she is kidnapped by a Fungus, one of Laverna\\'s henchmen. Elina wakes up and is accused of being responsible for Azura\\'s disappearance, but is rescued by Hue, a giant butterfly. In Laverna\\'s lair, the Fungi arrive with Azura, but Laverna is angered when she finds her necklace missing. The Fungi tell Laverna that a wingless fairy had it. Realizing a wingless fairy would be unaffected by her formula, Laverna orders the Fungi to find Elina.\\nHue and Elina are pursued by Laverna\\'s firebirds. They manage to evade them when merman Prince Nalu gives them seaweed that allows them to breathe underwater. When the group finally reach Dahlia’s home, she is reluctant to help as the other guardians were mistrustful of her, but Elina convinces her to do the right thing. Dahlia tells Elina that Laverna found a way to suck the powers from the fairy guardians\\' necklaces and transfer them to herself, stating that the \"union point\" would be its weakness.\\nThe group arrives at Laverna\\'s lair, planning to go in and find the union point, but Elina insists on going by herself as she has Azura\\'s necklace. While her friends cause a distraction, Elina makes it inside. Elina finds the guardians and her friends, captured by the Fungi. Laverna agrees to let them go if Elina returns Azura\\'s necklace, which she refuses, whereupon Laverna notices the rainbow in her eye. Laverna promises that she can give Elina wings in exchange for returning Azura\\'s necklace. Hypnotized, Elina walks toward Azura with the necklace. The union point—a crystal embedded in Laverna\\'s throne—begins to absorb the power from the guardians\\' necklaces. Just as the Elina is about to return the necklace, Azura\\'s words reach her, and she snaps out of her trance. Rejecting Laverna\\'s offer, Elina hurls the necklace at the union point, shattering it. The guardians\\' powers overwhelm Laverna and she vanishes.\\nBack in the Magic Meadow, the fairies and the flowers are cured. Elina and her friends are visited by the recovered Enchantress. She thanks Elina and her friends for saving everyone and rewards her with her own magic necklace. The necklace magically bestows Elina with her own pair of wings.

Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly scored it a B+, noting a generally \"feminist\" story.  TV Guide\\'s Robert Pardi scored it 2.5/4, praising the \"peppy score\" and classic story as distinguishing an otherwise \"ordinary Mattel-icized version of the classic tale\".Reviewing the film for Common Sense Media, Tracy Moore found the animation quality was improved from previous CGI Barbie films, and advised that parents \"may appreciate attention drawn to class inequality, and the precious few scenes focusing on girls liking science, books, and less passive pursuits.\" Moore wrote that the film \"almost succeed[s]\" in updating traditional models for girls\\' entertainment, as Princess Anneliese and Erika are shown \"putting [their interests] first over romance [...] But the big finish still centers around them pairing off, fairy-tale style.\" In The Dallas Morning News, Nancy Churnin praised the lead characters as \"bold and brainy\" and found, \"one of the sweetest aspects of this film is the utter absence of jealousy between Anneliese and Erika. Good things happen, ultimately, because of their mutual friendship and support.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Awards ===\\n\\n\\n== Video game ==\\nA video game for Game Boy Advance, PC, and Macintosh was released in 2004 by Vivendi Universal Games.

On the night of the dance, her friends arrive and tell her that she has to perform with them, giving her the dress that they put on hold for her at the mall.\\nStill worried as she has no bracelet, Kevin takes one of his guitar strings and loops it around her wrist. Barbie points out that it is a \"stupid piece of bent metal\" until she realizes that is what her bracelet was. The girls rock the concert with Courtney finally able to do a drum stick maneuver that she couldn\\'t do before. While dancing with Todd she asks him about the notes in her locker but he denies knowing about any notes. Confused, Barbie thinks back to other people who were in the places the notes had said. Realizing that it was Kevin all along, Barbie leaves in the middle of the dance and goes over to Kevin. Kevin gives her back the charm bracelet that he found on the ground. She apologizes for never realizing, but points out that the bizarre rhyming in the notes was a giveaway. The two dance together and become a couple.

It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 0}),\n",

It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I\\'m a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don\\'t agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that\\'s ok. This movie wasn\\'t designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I\\'ll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 3}),\n",

And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 14}),\n",

However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 17}),\n",

I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It\\'s clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner\\'s feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person\\'s life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)\\nI can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the \"not taking itself serious\" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 33}),\n",

It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 36}),\n",

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 40}),\n",

And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 63}),\n",

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 64}),\n",

Important to remember because wow what a talented individual. Recent memory sees him leading roles that require a more stoic subdued approach, and it can be easy to miss his range. Barbie seeks to utilize all his acting muscles, and to a resounding success. He can sing, dance, act, and do comedy.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 67}),\n",

The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 68}),\n",

With the highest potential in style, aesthetics, cast and concept, the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of it's main idea. And it's not feminism that bothers, surely not, it's the artistic language in which the idea is told - harsh, manipulative, abusive, straightforward and unkind. Instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect, it shoves the manifestations down your throat, and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watch.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 70}),\n",

There is still originality out there. This movie was very funny - the scene with Ken and the doctor in LA made me laugh very hard. It's weird and inventive. It has amazing choreography. So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment.

The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 81}),\n",

The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well.

The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 110}),\n",

This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content....\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 115}),\n",

Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 116}),\n",

One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 119}),\n",
