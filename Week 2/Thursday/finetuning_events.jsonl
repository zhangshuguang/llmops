It can be used for warmth, as a makeshift bed or blanket, for protection against noxious fumes or dangerous animals, as a distress signal, and for drying oneself off. Additionally, if a non-hitchhiker discovers that a hitchhiker has a towel, they will assume that the hitchhiker is also in possession of other useful items and will be more likely to lend them to the hitchhiker. The presence of a towel indicates that the hitchhiker is resourceful and capable, earning them respect and recognition among other hitchhikers."}]}
